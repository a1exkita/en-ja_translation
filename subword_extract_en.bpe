 L@@ ast year I show@@ ed these two sli@@ des so that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice cap@@ , which for most of the last three million years has been the si@@ ze of the low@@ er 4@@ 8 st@@ ates, has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 perc@@ ent.    
 But this underst@@ ates the seri@@ ous@@ ness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of the ic@@ e.    
 The ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is, in a sen@@ se, the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system.    
 It exp@@ ands in win@@ ter and con@@ trac@@ ts in sum@@ mer@@ .    
 The next sli@@ de I show you will be a ra@@ pi@@ d fa@@ st@@ -@@ forward of what's happened over the last 2@@ 5 years.    
 The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in re@@ d.    
 As you see, it exp@@ ands to the dar@@ k bl@@ ue -- that's the an@@ nu@@ al ice in w@@ inter@@ , and it con@@ trac@@ ts in sum@@ mer@@ .    
 The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ic@@ e, five years old or old@@ er, you can see is almost like bloo@@ d, sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here.    
 In 2@@ 5 years it's gone from this, to this.    
 This is a problem because the war@@ m@@ ing he@@ at@@ s up the f@@ ro@@ z@@ en grou@@ nd around the Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ c@@ e@@ an, where there is a mas@@ sive amount of f@@ ro@@ z@@ en car@@ b@@ on whi@@ ch, when it th@@ aw@@ s, is turned into me@@ th@@ an@@ e by micro@@ b@@ es.    
 C@@ om@@ pa@@ red to the to@@ tal amount of global war@@ m@@ ing pol@@ lu@@ tion in the at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ e, that amount could d@@ ou@@ ble if we c@@ ross this ti@@ pp@@ ing poin@@ t.    
 Al@@ ready in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in Al@@ as@@ k@@ a, me@@ th@@ an@@ e is ac@@ tively bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the water.    
 P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or K@@ at@@ ey W@@ al@@ ter from the U@@ ni@@ versity of Al@@ as@@ k@@ a went out with another team to another sh@@ allow la@@ ke last w@@ inter@@ .    
 Video: Wh@@ o@@ a@@ ! A@@ l G@@ ore@@ : S@@ he's oka@@ y. The question is whether we will be.    
 And one reason is, this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ at@@ s up Gre@@ en@@ land from the nor@@ th.    
 This is an an@@ nu@@ al m@@ el@@ ting ri@@ ver.    
 But the volu@@ m@@ es are much larg@@ er than ever@@ .    
 This is the K@@ ang@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q Ri@@ ver in sou@@ th@@ w@@ est Gre@@ en@@ lan@@ d.    
 If you want to know how se@@ a level ri@@ ses from lan@@ d-@@ bas@@ e ice m@@ el@@ ting this is where it reach@@ es the se@@ a.    
 These flow@@ s are increas@@ ing very ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly.    
 At the other end of the plane@@ t, An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a the larg@@ est ma@@ ss of ice on the planet.    
 L@@ ast mon@@ th scientists repor@@ ted the entire contin@@ ent is now in nega@@ tive ice bal@@ anc@@ e.    
 And w@@ est An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a c@@ ro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ se@@ a is@@ lan@@ ds, is particularly ra@@ pi@@ d in its m@@ el@@ t@@ ing.    
 That's equ@@ al to 20 fe@@ et of se@@ a level@@ , as is Gre@@ en@@ lan@@ d.    
 In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as, the third larg@@ est ma@@ ss of ic@@ e: at the top you see new la@@ k@@ es, which a few years ago were g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ ers.    
 40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their d@@ rin@@ king water from that m@@ el@@ ting flow@@ .    
 In the An@@ d@@ es, this g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ er is the sour@@ ce of d@@ rin@@ king water for this city.    
 The flow@@ s have increas@@ ed.    
 But when they go away, so does much of the d@@ rin@@ king water.    
 In Californi@@ a there has been a 40 percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the Si@@ er@@ r@@ a s@@ now@@ pac@@ k.    
 This is h@@ it@@ ting the res@@ er@@ vo@@ ir@@ s.    
 And the pre@@ dic@@ tions, as you've rea@@ d, are seri@@ ous.    
 This d@@ r@@ ying around the world has le@@ ad to a drama@@ tic increase in fi@@ re@@ s.    
 And the disa@@ st@@ ers around the world have been increas@@ ing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ p@@ rec@@ ed@@ ent@@ ed r@@ ate.    
 F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5@@ .    
 This is a completely un@@ sustain@@ able patter@@ n.    
 If you look at in the cont@@ ext of history you can see what this is do@@ ing.    
 In the last five years we've ad@@ ded 7@@ 0 million tons of CO2 every 2@@ 4 hours -- 2@@ 5 million tons every day to the oce@@ an@@ s.    
 L@@ oo@@ k care@@ fully at the area of the ea@@ ster@@ n P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic@@ , from the Ameri@@ ca@@ s, ex@@ ten@@ ding w@@ es@@ tw@@ ar@@ d, and on ei@@ ther side of the Indi@@ an sub@@ contin@@ ent, where there is a radi@@ cal de@@ ple@@ tion of o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en in the oce@@ an@@ s.    
 The biggest single cause of global war@@ m@@ ing, along with de@@ fore@@ sta@@ tion, which is 20 percent of it, is the bur@@ ning of f@@ os@@ si@@ l fuel@@ s.    
 O@@ il is a proble@@ m, and coal is the most seri@@ ous problem.    
 The United States is one of the two larg@@ est em@@ it@@ ters, along with Chin@@ a.    
 And the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more coal plan@@ ts.    
 But we're beginning to see a se@@ a change.    
 Here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some gre@@ en alter@@ na@@ tiv@@ es pro@@ po@@ se@@ d.    
   H@@ o@@ we@@ ver there is a political bat@@ tle in our countr@@ y.    
 And the coal indu@@ stri@@ es and the o@@ il indu@@ stri@@ es spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ en@@ da@@ r year prom@@ o@@ ting clean co@@ al, which is an o@@ x@@ y@@ mor@@ on.    
 That image re@@ min@@ ded me of some@@ thing.    
   A@@ rou@@ nd Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s, in my home in T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ see, a billion g@@ all@@ ons of coal s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ il@@ le@@ d.    
 You probably saw it on the new@@ s.    
 Th@@ is, all over the countr@@ y, is the second larg@@ est wa@@ ste st@@ ream in Ameri@@ ca@@ .    
 This happened around Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s.    
 One of the coal indu@@ str@@ y's ad@@ s around Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as was this one.    
 Video: ♪@@ ♫ F@@ ro@@ st@@ y the coal man is a j@@ ol@@ ly, happy sou@@ l@@ .

 This is one of them, part of one of them.    
 Video: A@@ c@@ tor@@ : At CO@@ A@@ L@@ erg@@ y we view climate change as a very seri@@ ous thre@@ at to our busin@@ ess.    
 That's why we've made it our pri@@ mar@@ y goal to spend a large su@@ m of money on an ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ing eff@@ ort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about co@@ al.    
 The fact is, coal isn't di@@ r@@ ty.    
 We think it's clean -- sm@@ ell@@ s goo@@ d, too@@ .    
 So don't wor@@ ry about climate change.    
 L@@ ea@@ ve that up to us.    
   Video: A@@ c@@ tor@@ : C@@ le@@ an coal -- you've heard a lot about it.

 And while bur@@ ning coal is one of the lead@@ ing caus@@ es of global war@@ m@@ ing, the re@@ mar@@ k@@ able clean coal technology you see here changes every@@ thing.

 Thank you very much.    
 L@@ ast year at TED I gave an intro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C@@ .    
 And I prom@@ is@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ d@@ ate on how that machine wor@@ ke@@ d.    
 So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there, the L@@ H@@ C is the larg@@ est scientific experi@@ ment ever at@@ temp@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters in cir@@ cu@@ m@@ fer@@ ence.    
 I@@ ts job is to re@@ create the condi@@ tions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the univer@@ se beg@@ an, up to 6@@ 00 million times a secon@@ d.    
 It's nothing if not ambi@@ ti@@ ous.    
 This is the machine bel@@ ow G@@ en@@ ev@@ a.    
 We take the pictures of those min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang@@ s inside de@@ te@@ c@@ tor@@ s.    
 This is the one I work on. It's called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S de@@ te@@ c@@ tor -- 4@@ 4 me@@ ters w@@ id@@ e, 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in di@@ am@@ e@@ ter.    
 S@@ pec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under construc@@ tion so you can see the scal@@ e.    
 On the 10@@ th of S@@ ep@@ te@@ mb@@ er last year we turned the machine on for the first time.    
 And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S.    
 It ca@@ used im@@ men@@ se c@@ ele@@ bra@@ tion in the control room.    
 It's a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C@@ , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C deli@@ ber@@ ately, and show@@ ering partic@@ les into the de@@ te@@ c@@ tor@@ .    
 In other words, when we saw that picture on S@@ ep@@ te@@ mb@@ er 10@@ th we knew the machine wor@@ ke@@ d, which is a great tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h.    
 I don't know whether this got the biggest che@@ er, or this, when someone went onto Goog@@ le and saw the front p@@ age was like that.    
 It means we made cul@@ tural impact as well as scientific imp@@ ac@@ t.    
 A@@ b@@ out a week later we had a problem with the mach@@ ine, rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of wi@@ re here -- these go@@ ld wi@@ re@@ s.    
 Th@@ ose wi@@ res car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thous@@ and am@@ ps when the machine is working in full pow@@ er.    
 Now the engine@@ ers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say, "@@ No they don@@ '@@ t. They're small wi@@ res@@ ."    
 They can do that because when they are very co@@ ld they are what's called super@@ con@@ duc@@ ting wi@@ re.    
 So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degre@@ es, col@@ der than the space between the star@@ s, those wi@@ res can take that cur@@ ren@@ t.    
 In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 magne@@ ts in L@@ H@@ C@@ , there was a man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ing de@@ fec@@ t.    
 So the wi@@ re he@@ ated up sli@@ ght@@ ly, and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps suddenly en@@ coun@@ tered elec@@ tri@@ cal re@@ si@@ stan@@ ce.    
 This was the resul@@ t.    
 Now that's more imp@@ res@@ sive when you consid@@ er those magne@@ ts we@@ i@@ gh over 20 ton@@ s, and they moved about a foo@@ t.    
 So we da@@ mag@@ ed about 50 of the magne@@ ts.    
 We had to take them out, which we di@@ d.    
 We re@@ condi@@ tion@@ ed them all, fi@@ x@@ ed them.    
 They're all on their way back under@@ grou@@ nd now.    
 By the end of M@@ arch the L@@ H@@ C will be in@@ t@@ act again.    
 We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on, and we ex@@ pect to take data in J@@ un@@ e or J@@ ul@@ y, and contin@@ ue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building bloc@@ ks of the univer@@ se are.    
 Now of course, in a way those acc@@ id@@ ents re@@ ig@@ n@@ ite the de@@ b@@ ate about the value of science and engine@@ ering at the ed@@ g@@ e. It's easy to re@@ fu@@ t@@ e.    
 I think that the fact that it's so diffic@@ ul@@ t, the fact that we're over@@ reach@@ ing, is the value of things like the L@@ H@@ C@@ .    
 I will leave the fin@@ al word to an Eng@@ lish scienti@@ st, H@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ re@@ y D@@ a@@ v@@ y, wh@@ o, I s@@ us@@ pec@@ t, when def@@ ending his prote@@ ge@@ 's us@@ el@@ ess experi@@ ments -- his prote@@ ge was M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el F@@ ar@@ a@@ day -- said this, "@@ No@@ thing is so danger@@ ous to the progres@@ s of the human mind than to as@@ su@@ me that our view@@ s of science are ultim@@ at@@ e, that there are no myster@@ ies in natu@@ re, that our tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s are comple@@ t@@ e, and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er@@ ."    
 Thank you.    
 I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid@@ , playing with bloc@@ ks.    
 As you figu@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gr@@ as@@ p, pick them up and move them aroun@@ d, you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al relationshi@@ p@@ s.    
 S@@ pati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is deep@@ ly connec@@ ted So, as a computer scienti@@ st inspi@@ red by this u@@ til@@ ity of our interac@@ tions with physical objec@@ ts -- along with my adv@@ is@@ er P@@ at@@ ti@@ e, and my collabor@@ at@@ or J@@ e@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- I started to won@@ der -- what if when we used a compu@@ ter, instead of having this one m@@ ouse cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a digital fing@@ er@@ ti@@ p moving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ top@@ , what if we could re@@ ach in with both hands and gr@@ as@@ p information physic@@ ally,    
 ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ing it the way we wan@@ te@@ d?    
 This question was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we decided to explor@@ e the answ@@ er, by building Si@@ f@@ tab@@ les.    
 In a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell, a Si@@ f@@ table is an interac@@ tive computer They're able to be moved around by han@@ d, they can sense each other@@ , they can sense their mo@@ tion, and they have a scre@@ en and a wi@@ re@@ less radi@@ o.    
 M@@ ost import@@ ant@@ ly, they're physic@@ al, so like the bloc@@ ks, you can move them just by reach@@ ing out and gr@@ as@@ p@@ ing.    
 And Si@@ f@@ tab@@ les are an example of a new ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of tools for man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating digital information.    
 And as these tools become more physic@@ al, more aw@@ are of their mo@@ tion, aw@@ are of each other@@ , and aw@@ are of the nu@@ ance of how we move them, we can start to explor@@ e some new and fu@@ n interac@@ tion st@@ y@@ les.    
 So, I'm going to start with some simple exam@@ pl@@ es.    
 This Si@@ f@@ table is con@@ figu@@ red to show vide@@ o, and if I til@@ t it in one direc@@ tion, it@@ 'll ro@@ ll the video this wa@@ y@@ ; if I til@@ t it the other way it ro@@ ll@@ s it back@@ war@@ ds.    
 And these interac@@ tive por@@ tra@@ its are aw@@ are of each other.    
 So if I put them next to each other@@ , they get interes@@ ted.    
 If they get sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded, they no@@ tice that to@@ o, they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed.    
 And they can also sense their mo@@ tion and til@@ t.    
 One of the interesting imp@@ li@@ cations on interac@@ tion, we started to real@@ iz@@ e, was that we could use every@@ day g@@ es@@ tures on dat@@ a, like p@@ our@@ ing a color the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ id@@ .    
 So in this case, we've got three Si@@ f@@ tab@@ les con@@ figu@@ red to be pain@@ t b@@ uc@@ ke@@ ts and I can use them to p@@ our color into that cent@@ ral one, where they get mi@@ x@@ ed.    
 If we over@@ sh@@ oo@@ t, we can p@@ our a little bit back.    
 There are also some ne@@ at possibili@@ ties for edu@@ cation, like langu@@ age, mat@@ h and logi@@ c games where we want to give people the ability to try things quick@@ ly, and view the resul@@ ts im@@ medi@@ at@@ el@@ y.    
 So here I'm -- This is a F@@ i@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequ@@ ence that I'm making with a simple equ@@ ation progr@@ am.    
 Here we have a word game that's kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -@@ up between S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ o@@ gg@@ le.    
 B@@ as@@ ic@@ ally, in every rou@@ nd you get a ran@@ dom@@ ly assig@@ ned let@@ ter on each Si@@ f@@ table, and as you try to make words it chec@@ ks against a dic@@ tion@@ ary.    
 Th@@ en, after about 30 secon@@ ds, it re@@ sh@@ u@@ ff@@ l@@ es, and you have a new set of let@@ ters and new possibili@@ ties to tr@@ y.    
   Thank you.    
   So these are some kids that came on a fiel@@ d tri@@ p to the M@@ edi@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I manag@@ ed to get them to try it out, and sh@@ oo@@ t a vide@@ o.    
 They really loved it.    
 And, one of the interesting things about this kind of appli@@ cation is that you don't have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions.    
 All you have to say is, "@@ Ma@@ ke wor@@ ds@@ ," and they know exactly what to do.    
 So here's another few people trying it out.    
 That's our youn@@ g@@ est bet@@ a tes@@ ter, down there on the right.    
 T@@ ur@@ ns out, all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ f@@ tab@@ les up.    
 So to him, they were just bloc@@ ks.    
 Now, this is an interac@@ tive car@@ to@@ on appli@@ ca@@ tion.    
 And we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ n@@ ers.    
 And this is F@@ e@@ li@@ x, actu@@ ally.    
 And he can bring new charac@@ ters into the scen@@ e, just by lif@@ ting the Si@@ f@@ tab@@ les off the table that have that charac@@ ter shown on them.    
 H@@ er@@ e, he's br@@ ing@@ ing the su@@ n out.    
 Video: The su@@ n is ris@@ ing.    
 D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ er@@ r@@ ill@@ : Now he's brought a trac@@ tor into the scen@@ e.    
 Video: The or@@ ange trac@@ tor@@ .    
 G@@ ood job@@ ! Yea@@ h@@ !    
 D@@ M@@ : So by sha@@ king the Si@@ f@@ tab@@ les and putting them next to each other he can make the charac@@ ters inter@@ act -- Video: W@@ oo@@ f@@ !    
 D@@ M@@ : invent@@ ing his own nar@@ ra@@ tive.    
 Video: H@@ el@@ lo@@ !    
 D@@ M@@ : It's an op@@ en@@ -@@ ended story, and he gets to dec@@ ide how it un@@ fol@@ ds.    
 Video: F@@ ly away, cat@@ .    
 D@@ M@@ : So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ enc@@ ing and live perfor@@ man@@ ce tool in which Si@@ f@@ tab@@ les act as soun@@ ds like lea@@ d, bas@@ s and d@@ ru@@ m@@ s.    
 E@@ ach of these has four different vari@@ a@@ tions, you get to choose which one you want to us@@ e.    
 And you can in@@ jec@@ t these soun@@ ds into a sequ@@ ence that you can as@@ se@@ mb@@ le into the patter@@ n that you wan@@ t.    
 And you in@@ jec@@ t it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound Si@@ f@@ table against a sequ@@ ence Si@@ f@@ tab@@ le.    
 There are effec@@ ts that you can control liv@@ e, like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter.    
 You att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then til@@ t to ad@@ just it.    
 And then, over@@ all effec@@ ts like temp@@ o and volu@@ me that app@@ ly to the entire sequ@@ ence.    
 So let's have a loo@@ k.    
 Video: D@@ M@@ : We@@ 'll start by putting a le@@ ad into two sequ@@ ence Si@@ f@@ tab@@ l@@ es, ar@@ ran@@ ge them into a seri@@ es, ex@@ t@@ end it, ad@@ d a little more lea@@ d.    
 Now I put a bas@@ s line in.    
 Video: D@@ M@@ : Now I'll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in.    
 Video: D@@ M@@ : And now I'll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the d@@ ru@@ ms, so I can control the effec@@ t liv@@ e.    
 Video: D@@ M@@ : I can spe@@ ed up the whole sequ@@ ence by til@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other.    
 Video: D@@ M@@ : And now I'll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more ex@@ pres@@ sion.    
 Video: D@@ M@@ : I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the sequ@@ ence while it play@@ s.    
 making it longer or shor@@ ter as I go.    
 And now, finally, I can f@@ ad@@ e the whole sequ@@ ence out using the volu@@ me Si@@ f@@ table, til@@ ted to the lef@@ t.    
   Thank you.    
 So, as you can see, my passion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibili@@ ties that we're working to bring out of the labor@@ ator@@ y.    
 So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for interac@@ ting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our ter@@ m@@ s.    
 Thank you very much.    
 I look forward to talking with all of you.    
 I am a writ@@ er.    
 W@@ r@@ iting books is my prof@@ es@@ sion but it's more than that, of cour@@ se.    
 It is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation.    
 And I don't ex@@ pect that that's ever going to change.    
 But, that said, something kind of pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar has happened rec@@ ently in my life and in my care@@ er, which has ca@@ used me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole relationship with this work.    
 And the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar thing is that I rec@@ ently wrote this book, this me@@ mo@@ ir called "@@ E@@ at, P@@ ra@@ y, L@@ o@@ ve@@ " whi@@ ch, dec@@ ide@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous boo@@ ks, went out in the world for some reas@@ on, and became this bi@@ g, me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ sa@@ tion, inter@@ national b@@ est@@ sel@@ l@@ er thing.    
 The result of which is that every@@ where I go now, people tre@@ at me like I'm do@@ om@@ ed.    
 S@@ eri@@ ously -- do@@ om@@ ed, do@@ om@@ ed@@ !    
 Li@@ ke, they come up to me now, all wor@@ ri@@ ed, and they say, "A@@ re@@ n't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that?    
 A@@ re@@ n't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world ca@@ res about at all, ever again@@ ?"    
 So that's reas@@ sur@@ ing, you know.    
 But it would be wor@@ se, excep@@ t for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er, when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writ@@ er, I was met with this same sort of fear@@ -@@ based reac@@ tion.    
 And people would say, "A@@ re@@ n't you afraid you're never going to have any success@@ ?    
 A@@ re@@ n't you afraid the hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation of re@@ jec@@ tion will kill you@@ ?    
 A@@ re@@ n't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this cra@@ ft and no@@ thing@@ 's ever going to come of it and you're going to di@@ e on a sc@@ ra@@ p hea@@ p of bro@@ ken dre@@ ams Li@@ ke that, you know.    
 The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "@@ Y@@ es@@ ."    
 Y@@ es, I'm afraid of all those things.    
 And I always have be@@ en.    
 And I'm afraid of man@@ y, many more things b@@ es@@ id@@ es that people can't even gu@@ ess at, like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ary.    
 But, when it comes to writ@@ ing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lat@@ ely, and wonder@@ ing about lat@@ ely, You know, is it ra@@ tion@@ al@@ ?    
 Is it logical that anybody should be expec@@ ted to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.    
 And what is it speci@@ fic@@ ally about creative ven@@ tures that seems to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each other@@ 's mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don't do, you know@@ ?    
 Li@@ ke my da@@ d, for example, was a chemical engine@@ er and I don't rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chemical engine@@ ering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engine@@ er, you know@@ ?    
 "@@ That chemic@@ al@@ -@@ engine@@ ering bloc@@ k, Jo@@ h@@ n, h@@ ow@@ 's it go@@ ing@@ ?"    
 It just didn't come up like that, you know@@ ?    
 But to be fa@@ ir@@ , chemical engine@@ ers as a group haven't really ear@@ ned a re@@ pu@@ ta@@ tion over the cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es We writ@@ ers, we kind of do have that re@@ pu@@ ta@@ tion, and not just writ@@ ers, but creative people across all gen@@ re@@ s, it seem@@ s, have this re@@ pu@@ ta@@ tion for being en@@ or@@ m@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ able.    
 And all you have to do is look at the very g@@ ri@@ m death coun@@ t in the 20@@ th centur@@ y al@@ one, of really mag@@ nific@@ ent creative min@@ ds who died young and often at their own han@@ ds, you know@@ ?    
 And even the ones who didn't literally comm@@ it suic@@ ide seem to be really und@@ one by their gi@@ f@@ ts, you know.    
 Nor@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er, just before he di@@ ed, last inter@@ view@@ , he said, "@@ Every one of my books has killed me a little mo@@ re@@ ."    
 A@@ n extraordinary st@@ at@@ ement to make about your life@@ 's work.    
 But we don't even bl@@ ink when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and some@@ how we've completely inter@@ nal@@ ized and acc@@ ep@@ ted collec@@ tively this no@@ tion that creativ@@ ity and suffer@@ ing are some@@ how in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y, in the end, will always ultim@@ ately le@@ ad to an@@ gu@@ ish@@ .    
 And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all c@@ ool with that idea@@ ?    
 Are you comfor@@ table with that?    
 Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and, you know -- I'm not at all comfor@@ table with that as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion.    
 I think it's o@@ di@@ ous.    
 And I also think it's danger@@ ous, and I don't want to see it per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated into the next centur@@ y.    
 I think it's better if we en@@ courage our great creative min@@ ds to liv@@ e.    
 And I defin@@ it@@ ely know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very danger@@ ous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dar@@ k pat@@ h of as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion, particularly given the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ce that I'm in right now in my care@@ er.    
 Wh@@ ich is -- you know, like chec@@ k it out, I'm pretty youn@@ g, I'm only about 40 years ol@@ d.    
 I still have maybe another four deca@@ des of work left in me.    
 And it's exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judg@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the f@@ rea@@ k@@ ish success of my last book, right?    
 I should just put it bl@@ un@@ t@@ ly, because we're all sort of friends here now -- it's exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.    
 So J@@ es@@ us, what a thou@@ ght@@ !    
 That's the kind of thought that could le@@ ad a person to start d@@ rin@@ king g@@ in at nine o@@ '@@ clo@@ ck in the morning, and I don't want to go there.    
   I would pre@@ f@@ er to keep doing this work that I lo@@ ve.    
 And so, the question be@@ com@@ es, h@@ ow@@ ?    
 And so, it seems to me, up@@ on a lot of ref@@ lec@@ tion, that the way that I have to work now, in order to contin@@ ue writ@@ ing, is that I have to create some sort of prote@@ c@@ tive psycho@@ logical construc@@ t, right?    
 I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ fe di@@ stan@@ ce between me, as I am writ@@ ing, and my very natural an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty about what the reac@@ tion to that writing is going to be, from now on.    
 And, as I've been loo@@ king, over the last year, I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other socie@@ ties to see if they might have had better and s@@ an@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent emo@@ tional ris@@ ks of creativ@@ ity.    
 And that se@@ arch has led me to ancient G@@ ree@@ ce and ancient R@@ om@@ e.    
 So sta@@ y with me, because it does cir@@ cle around and back.    
 But, ancient G@@ ree@@ ce and ancient R@@ ome -- people did not happen to believe that creativ@@ ity came from human be@@ ings back then, O@@ K@@ ?    
 People believ@@ ed that creativ@@ ity was this di@@ v@@ ine att@@ end@@ ant spi@@ rit that came to human be@@ ings from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able sour@@ ce, for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reas@@ on@@ s.    
 The G@@ ree@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine att@@ end@@ ant spir@@ its of creativ@@ ity "@@ da@@ em@@ on@@ s."    
 S@@ oc@@ r@@ ates, fam@@ ous@@ ly, believ@@ ed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spo@@ ke wis@@ dom to him from af@@ ar@@ .    
 The R@@ om@@ ans had the same idea@@ , but they called that sort of dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died creative spi@@ rit a gen@@ i@@ us.    
 Wh@@ ich is great@@ , because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a particularly cle@@ ver individu@@ al.    
 They believ@@ ed that a gen@@ i@@ us was this, sort of ma@@ gi@@ cal di@@ v@@ ine enti@@ ty, who was believ@@ ed to literally live in the w@@ all@@ s of an arti@@ st@@ 's stu@@ di@@ o, kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the house el@@ f@@ , and sort of in@@ vi@@ sib@@ ly as@@ si@@ st the arti@@ st with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work.    
 So br@@ illi@@ ant -- there it is, right there, that di@@ stan@@ ce that I'm talking about -- that psycho@@ logical construc@@ t to prote@@ ct you from the resul@@ ts of your work.    
 And everyone knew that this is how it fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ed, right?    
 So the ancient arti@@ st was prote@@ c@@ ted from certain things, like, for example, too much nar@@ ci@@ s@@ si@@ sm@@ , right?    
 If your work was br@@ illi@@ ant, you couldn't take all the cre@@ di@@ t for it, everybody knew that you had this dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died gen@@ i@@ us who had helped you.    
 If your work b@@ om@@ be@@ d, not enti@@ rely your fa@@ ul@@ t, you know@@ ?    
 Every@@ one knew your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of l@@ am@@ e.    
 And this is how people thought about creativ@@ ity in the W@@ est for a really long time.    
 And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything chan@@ ge@@ d, and we had this big idea@@ , and the big idea was, let's put the individual human being at the cent@@ er of the univer@@ se abo@@ ve all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies, and there's no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatu@@ res who take dic@@ ta@@ tion from the di@@ v@@ ine.    
 And it's the beginning of ra@@ tional human@@ ism, and people started to believe that creativ@@ ity came completely from the self of the individu@@ al.    
 And for the first time in hi@@ story, you start to hear people ref@@ er@@ r@@ ing to this or that arti@@ st as being a gen@@ i@@ us, rather than having a gen@@ i@@ us.    
 And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge er@@ r@@ or.    
 You know, I think that allow@@ ing some@@ bod@@ y, one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like, the v@@ es@@ sel@@ , of all di@@ v@@ ine, creativ@@ e, un@@ know@@ able, e@@ ter@@ n@@ al myster@@ y is just a sm@@ id@@ ge too much respon@@ sib@@ ility to put on one fra@@ gi@@ le, human psy@@ ch@@ e.    
 It's like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun@@ .    
 It just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s, and it cre@@ ates all these un@@ man@@ a@@ ge@@ able expec@@ ta@@ tions about perfor@@ man@@ ce.    
 And I think the pres@@ sure of that has been kill@@ ing off our arti@@ sts for the last 500 years.    
 And, if this is tru@@ e, and I think it is tru@@ e, the question be@@ com@@ es, what now@@ ?    
 Can we do this differ@@ ent@@ l@@ y?    
 about the relationship between human@@ s and the creative myster@@ y.    
 Maybe no@@ t.    
 Maybe we can't just er@@ ase 500 years of ra@@ tional human@@ istic thought in one 1@@ 8 min@@ u@@ te spe@@ e@@ ch.    
 And there's probably people in this audi@@ ence who would ra@@ ise really le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate scientific s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ ons about the no@@ tion of, bas@@ ic@@ ally, fa@@ i@@ ri@@ es who follow people around ru@@ b@@ bing fa@@ ir@@ y ju@@ ice on their projec@@ ts and stuff@@ .    
 I'm not, prob@@ ab@@ ly, going to bring you all along with me on this.    
 But the question that I kind of want to p@@ ose is -- you know, why no@@ t?    
 Why not think about it this wa@@ y?    
 Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining the ut@@ ter ma@@ dd@@ ening ca@@ pri@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness of the creative proc@@ ess.    
 A process whi@@ ch, as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have ra@@ tion@@ ally.    
 And, in fact, can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal@@ .    
 I had this en@@ coun@@ ter rec@@ ently where I met the extraordinary American po@@ et R@@ u@@ th St@@ one, who's now in her 9@@ 0@@ s, but she's been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in ru@@ ral V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a, she would be out working in the fiel@@ ds, and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ e@@ m coming at her from over the lan@@ ds@@ cap@@ e.    
 And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of air@@ .    
 And it would come bar@@ re@@ ling down at her over the lan@@ ds@@ cap@@ e.    
 And she felt it com@@ ing, because it would sha@@ ke the ear@@ th under her fe@@ e@@ t.    
 She knew that she had only one thing to do at that poin@@ t, and that was to, in her words, "@@ run like h@@ ell@@ ."    
 And she would run like hel@@ l to the house and she would be getting cha@@ sed by this po@@ em@@ , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of pa@@ per and a pen@@ ci@@ l fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her, she could colle@@ ct it and gra@@ b it on the p@@ age.    
 And other times she wouldn't be fast enou@@ gh, so she'd be run@@ ning and run@@ ning, and she wouldn't get to the house and the po@@ e@@ m would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would contin@@ ue on across the lan@@ ds@@ cap@@ e, loo@@ king, as she put it "@@ for another po@@ et@@ ."    
 And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were moments where she would almost mis@@ s it, right?    
 So, she's run@@ ning to the house and she's looking for the pa@@ per and the po@@ e@@ m pas@@ ses through her, and she gr@@ ab@@ s a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other hand and she would cat@@ ch it.    
 She would cat@@ ch the po@@ e@@ m by its ta@@ il, and she would pul@@ l it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ sc@@ ri@@ bing on the p@@ age.    
 And in these instan@@ c@@ es, the po@@ e@@ m would come up on the p@@ age perfect and in@@ t@@ act but back@@ war@@ ds, from the last word to the fir@@ st.    
   So when I heard that I was like -- that's un@@ can@@ n@@ y, that's exactly what my creative process is lik@@ e.    
   That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine@@ !    
 I'm a mu@@ le, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and s@@ we@@ at and lab@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ly.    
 But even I@@ , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness, even I have br@@ us@@ h@@ ed up against that thing, at times.    
 And I would imagine that a lot of you have too@@ .    
 You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a sour@@ ce that I hon@@ es@@ tly cannot identi@@ f@@ y.    
 And what is that thing@@ ?    
 And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lo@@ se our min@@ ds, bu@@ t, in fact, might actually keep us s@@ an@@ e?    
 And for me, the best contemp@@ or@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ic@@ ian T@@ om W@@ a@@ it@@ s, who I got to inter@@ view several years ago on a mag@@ az@@ ine assig@@ n@@ ment.    
 And we were talking about this, and you know, T@@ om@@ , for most of his life, he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ mented contemp@@ or@@ ary moder@@ n arti@@ st, trying to control and man@@ age and dom@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able creative imp@@ ul@@ ses that were totally inter@@ nal@@ iz@@ ed.    
 But then he got old@@ er, he got cal@@ m@@ er, and one day he was dri@@ ving down the free@@ way in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es, and this is when it all changed for him.    
 And he's spe@@ e@@ ding al@@ ong, and all of a sudd@@ en he hear@@ s this little fra@@ g@@ ment of m@@ el@@ o@@ d@@ y, that comes into his head as inspi@@ ra@@ tion often com@@ es, el@@ usi@@ ve and t@@ an@@ tal@@ iz@@ ing, and he wan@@ ts it, it's g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous, and he long@@ s for it, but he has no way to get it.    
 He doesn't have a piece of pa@@ per@@ , or a p@@ enc@@ il, or a ta@@ pe rec@@ ord@@ er.    
 So he starts to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty start to ri@@ se in him like, "I'm going to lo@@ se this thing, and I'll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this s@@ ong fore@@ ver.    
 I'm not good enou@@ gh, and I can't do it@@ ."    
 And instead of pan@@ ic@@ king, he just stop@@ pe@@ d.    
 He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely no@@ vel@@ .    
 He just looked up at the sk@@ y, and he said, "@@ E@@ x@@ c@@ use me, can you not see that I'm dri@@ v@@ ing@@ ?"    
   "@@ Do I look like I can write down a s@@ ong right now@@ ?    
 If you really want to exist@@ , come back at a more oppor@@ tu@@ ne moment when I can take care of you.    
 O@@ ther@@ wis@@ e, go bo@@ ther somebody else today.    
 G@@ o bo@@ ther Le@@ on@@ ard Co@@ h@@ en@@ ."    
 And his whole work process changed after that.    
 Not the work, the work was still of@@ ten@@ times as dar@@ k as ever@@ .    
 But the proc@@ ess, and the hea@@ v@@ y an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty around it was rele@@ as@@ ed when he took the gen@@ i@@ e, the gen@@ i@@ us out of him where it was ca@@ using nothing but tr@@ ou@@ b@@ le, and rele@@ as@@ ed it back where it came from@@ , and realized that this didn't have to be this inter@@ nal@@ iz@@ ed, tor@@ mented thing.    
 It could be this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar, won@@ d@@ rou@@ s, bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re collabor@@ ation, kind of conversation between T@@ om and the strang@@ e, ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al thing that was not quite T@@ om@@ .    
 When I heard that story, it started to shi@@ ft a little bit the way that I worked to@@ o, and this idea already sa@@ ved me on@@ ce.    
 It sa@@ ved me when I was in the middle of writing "@@ E@@ at, P@@ ra@@ y, L@@ o@@ ve@@ ," and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ pa@@ ir that we all f@@ all into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disa@@ st@@ er, the worst book ever writ@@ t@@ en.    
 Not just ba@@ d, but the worst book ever writ@@ t@@ en.    
 And I started to think I should just du@@ m@@ p this projec@@ t.    
 But then I rememb@@ ered T@@ om talking to the open air and I tried it.    
 So I just lif@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ p@@ t and I direc@@ ted my com@@ ments to an emp@@ ty cor@@ ner of the room.    
 And I said al@@ ou@@ d, "@@ L@@ ist@@ en you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't br@@ illi@@ ant that is not enti@@ rely my fa@@ ul@@ t, right?    
 Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this.    
 If you want it to be bet@@ ter, you've got to show up and do your part of the de@@ al.    
 But if you don't do that, you know what@@ , the hel@@ l with it.    
 I'm going to keep writing any@@ way because that's my job@@ .    
 And I would please like the rec@@ ord to ref@@ le@@ ct today that I show@@ ed up for my part of the job@@ ."    
   Because -- Because in the end it's like this, O@@ K -- cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es ago in the deser@@ ts of North Afri@@ ca, people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light danc@@ es of s@@ ac@@ red d@@ ance and music that would go on for hours and hour@@ s, until da@@ w@@ n.    
 They were always mag@@ nific@@ ent, because the danc@@ ers were prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als and they were terri@@ fic@@ , right?    
 But every once in a whi@@ le, very ra@@ re@@ ly, something would happen@@ , and one of these perfor@@ m@@ ers would actually become tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ent.    
 And I know you know what I'm talking ab@@ out, because I know you've all se@@ en, at some point in your life, It was like time would stop@@ , and the danc@@ er would sort of step through some kind of p@@ ort@@ al and he wasn't doing anything different but everything would al@@ ig@@ n.    
 And all of a sudd@@ en, he would no longer appe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely human@@ .    
 He would be li@@ t from wi@@ thin@@ , and li@@ t from bel@@ ow and all li@@ t up on fire with di@@ v@@ in@@ ity.    
 And when this happen@@ ed, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its nam@@ e.    
 They would put their hands together and they would start to chan@@ t, "@@ Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Go@@ d, Go@@ d, Go@@ d@@ ."    
 That's Go@@ d, you know.    
 C@@ u@@ ri@@ ous hi@@ stor@@ ical foo@@ t@@ no@@ te@@ : when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ ad@@ ed sou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in, they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the p@@ ron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es from "@@ Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h@@ ," to "O@@ l@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ ," which you still hear in bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ enc@@ o danc@@ es.    
 In S@@ pa@@ in, when a perfor@@ m@@ er has done something impos@@ sible and mag@@ ic, "@@ Al@@ la@@ h, ol@@ é@@ , ol@@ é@@ , Al@@ la@@ h, mag@@ nific@@ ent, bra@@ vo@@ ," in@@ comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ sib@@ le, there it is -- a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of Go@@ d.    
 Wh@@ ich is great@@ , because we need that.    
 But, the tric@@ k@@ y bit comes the next morning, for the danc@@ er hi@@ m@@ self, when he wa@@ kes up and discover@@ s that it's T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 1@@ 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ .@@ , and he's no longer a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of Go@@ d.    
 H@@ e's just an ag@@ ing mor@@ tal with really bad k@@ ne@@ es, and maybe he's never going to as@@ c@@ end to that he@@ ight again.    
 And maybe no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant Go@@ d@@ 's name again as he sp@@ in@@ s, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life@@ ?    
 This is har@@ d.    
 This is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life.    
 But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believ@@ e, in the first plac@@ e, that the most extraordinary as@@ pec@@ ts of your being came from you.    
 But maybe if you just believ@@ ed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some un@@ imagin@@ able sour@@ ce for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life to be pas@@ sed along when you're fin@@ ish@@ ed, with somebody el@@ se.    
 And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change every@@ thing.    
 This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be publi@@ sh@@ ed, as the danger@@ ous@@ ly, fri@@ ght@@ en@@ ingly over@@ -@@ an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated follow up to my f@@ rea@@ k@@ ish succ@@ ess.    
 And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psy@@ ched out about that is don't be afra@@ id@@ .    
 D@@ on@@ 't be da@@ un@@ ted. Just do your job@@ .    
 Con@@ tin@@ ue to show up for your piece of it, what@@ ever that might be.    
 If your job is to danc@@ e, do your danc@@ e.    
 If the di@@ v@@ ine, co@@ c@@ ke@@ yed gen@@ i@@ us assig@@ ned to your case dec@@ id@@ es to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be g@@ li@@ mp@@ se@@ d, for just one moment through your eff@@ ort@@ s, then "O@@ l@@ é@@ !@@ "    
 And if not, do your d@@ ance any@@ h@@ ow@@ .    
 And "O@@ l@@ é@@ !@@ " to you, n@@ one@@ the@@ l@@ ess.    
 I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.    
 "O@@ l@@ é@@ !@@ " to you, n@@ one@@ the@@ l@@ ess, just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up.    
 Thank you.    
   Thank you.    
   J@@ un@@ e Co@@ h@@ en@@ : O@@ l@@ é@@ !    
 You know, I've talked about some of these projec@@ ts before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean, and discover@@ ing new se@@ ts of gen@@ es.    
 We're actually starting at a new poin@@ t@@ : we've been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing bio@@ log@@ y, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new p@@ ha@@ se of bio@@ logy with desig@@ ning and syn@@ thes@@ izing life.    
 So, we've always been trying to ask big ques@@ tions.    
 "What is life@@ ?" is something that I think many bio@@ logi@@ sts have been trying to understand at vari@@ ous level@@ s.    
 We've tried vari@@ ous approach@@ es, par@@ ing it down to min@@ i@@ mal comp@@ on@@ ents.    
 We've been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 year@@ s@@ ; when we sequ@@ enc@@ ed the human gen@@ om@@ e, it was going from the an@@ al@@ o@@ g world of bio@@ logy into the digital world of the compu@@ ter.    
 Now we're trying to as@@ k, "@@ Can we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this digital univer@@ se@@ ?"    
 This is the ma@@ p of a small organ@@ ism, M@@ y@@ cop@@ las@@ m@@ a gen@@ it@@ ali@@ u@@ m, that has the sm@@ all@@ est gen@@ ome for a species that can self-@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate in the labor@@ ator@@ y, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ all@@ er gen@@ om@@ e.    
 We're able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 gen@@ es out of the 500 or so that are here.    
 When we look at its me@@ tab@@ o@@ li@@ c ma@@ p, it's rela@@ tively simple trust me, this is simple -- but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time, it's very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a living cell@@ .    
 So we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromos@@ ome so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ents And so we started down the road of@@ : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromos@@ ome@@ ?    
 Can chem@@ i@@ str@@ y per@@ m@@ it making these really large mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es where we've never been before@@ ?    
 And if we do, can we boo@@ t up a chromos@@ ome@@ ?    
 A chromos@@ om@@ e, by the way, is just a piece of in@@ er@@ t chemical materi@@ al.    
 So, our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increas@@ ing at an exp@@ on@@ ential pac@@ e.    
 Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty s@@ low@@ ly but has been increas@@ ing, and our lat@@ est point would put it on, now, an exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ve.    
 We started this over 15 years ago.    
 It took several st@@ ag@@ es, in fact, starting with a bio@@ e@@ thi@@ cal re@@ view before we did the first experi@@ ment@@ s.    
 But it turns out syn@@ thes@@ izing DN@@ A is very diffic@@ ul@@ t.    
 There are ten@@ s of thousands of mach@@ ines around the world that make small pieces of DN@@ A -- 30 to 50 let@@ ters in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it's a de@@ gener@@ ate proc@@ ess, so the longer you make the piec@@ e, the more er@@ r@@ ors there are. So we had to create a new me@@ th@@ od for putting these little pieces together and cor@@ rec@@ t all the er@@ ror@@ s.    
 And this was our first at@@ temp@@ t, starting with the digital information of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4@@ .    
 It's a small vir@@ us that kill@@ s bacteri@@ a.    
 We desig@@ ned the piec@@ es, went through our er@@ ro@@ r cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a DN@@ A mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le of about 5@@ ,000 let@@ ters.    
 The exc@@ iting p@@ ha@@ se came when we took this piece of in@@ er@@ t chemical and put it in the bacteri@@ a, and the bacteri@@ a started to read this genetic co@@ de, made the vi@@ ral partic@@ les.    
 The vi@@ ral partic@@ les then were rele@@ as@@ ed from the cell@@ s and came back and killed the E@@ . co@@ li@@ .    
 I was talking to the o@@ il indu@@ str@@ y rec@@ ently and I said they c@@ lear@@ ly underst@@ ood that model@@ .    
   They la@@ ugh@@ ed more than you guys are. And so, we think this is a situation where the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are can actually build its own har@@ d@@ w@@ are in a bio@@ logical system.    
 But we wanted to go much larg@@ er@@ : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al chromos@@ ome -- it's over 5@@ 80@@ ,000 let@@ ters of genetic code -- so we thought we@@ 'd build them in cas@@ se@@ tt@@ es the si@@ ze of the vir@@ us@@ es so we could actually v@@ ary the cas@@ se@@ tt@@ es to understand what the actu@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents of a living cell are.    
 D@@ es@@ ign is cri@@ tic@@ al, and if you're starting with digital information in the compu@@ ter, that digital information has to be really acc@@ ur@@ ate.    
 When we first sequ@@ enc@@ ed this gen@@ ome in 19@@ 9@@ 5@@ , the stand@@ ard of acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ ro@@ r per 10@@ ,000 bas@@ e pa@@ ir@@ s.    
 We actually foun@@ d, on re@@ sequ@@ enc@@ ing it, 30 er@@ ror@@ s@@ ; had we used that or@@ ig@@ in@@ al sequ@@ ence, it never would have been able to be boo@@ ted up.    
 Par@@ t of the design is desig@@ ning pieces that are 50 let@@ ters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0@@ -@@ let@@ ter pieces to build sm@@ all@@ er sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together.    
 We design unique el@@ em@@ ents into this.    
 You may have read that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in.    
 Th@@ ink of this: we have a four@@ -@@ let@@ ter genetic code -- A@@ , C@@ , G and T@@ .    
 T@@ ri@@ ple@@ ts of those let@@ ters code for rou@@ gh@@ ly 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id@@ s, such that there's a single let@@ ter desig@@ n@@ ation for each of the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id@@ s.    
 So we can use the genetic code to write out words, s@@ ent@@ enc@@ es, thou@@ ght@@ s.    
 I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ally, all we did was au@@ to@@ gra@@ p@@ h it.    
 Some people were disap@@ poin@@ ted there was not po@@ e@@ tr@@ y.    
 We desig@@ ned these pieces so we can just ch@@ ew back with en@@ z@@ y@@ mes@@ ; there are en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es that re@@ pa@@ ir them and put them together.    
 And we started making piec@@ es, starting with pieces that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ters, put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,00@@ 0@@ -@@ let@@ ter piec@@ es, then put se@@ ts of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,00@@ 0@@ .    
 At each st@@ age, we grew up these pieces in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we're trying to create a process that's ex@@ trem@@ ely rob@@ ust that you can see in a minut@@ e. We're trying to get to the point of au@@ tom@@ ation.    
 So, this looks like a bas@@ ke@@ t@@ b@@ all play@@ off.    
 When we get into these really large pieces over 1@@ 00@@ ,000 bas@@ e pa@@ ir@@ s, they won@@ 't any longer grow rea@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sts all the moder@@ n tools of mo@@ le@@ cu@@ lar bio@@ logy -- and so we turned to other mechan@@ is@@ m@@ s.    
 We knew there's a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ o@@ log@@ ous re@@ comb@@ in@@ ation that bio@@ logy us@@ es to re@@ pa@@ ir DN@@ A that can put pieces together.    
 Here's an example of it@@ : there's an organ@@ ism called that can take three milli@@ ons ra@@ ds of radi@@ ation.    
 You can see in the top pan@@ el, its chromos@@ ome just gets b@@ low@@ n a@@ par@@ t.    
 Tw@@ el@@ ve to 2@@ 4 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was before.    
 We have thousands of organ@@ is@@ ms that can do this.    
 These organ@@ is@@ ms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cat@@ ed@@ ; they can live in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ u@@ m.    
 I am absolutely certain that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter space, move aroun@@ d, find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous environ@@ ment.    
 In fact, N@@ A@@ S@@ A has shown a lot of this is out there.    
 Here's an actu@@ al micro@@ gra@@ p@@ h of the mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le we built using these process@@ es, actually just using ye@@ ast mechan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in@@ ; ye@@ ast pu@@ ts them together au@@ tom@@ a@@ tic@@ ally.    
 This is not an elec@@ tr@@ on micro@@ graph@@ ; this is just a re@@ gu@@ lar pho@@ tom@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph@@ .    
 It's such a large mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le we can see it with a light micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e.    
 These are pictures over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ second peri@@ o@@ d.    
 So, this is the publi@@ cation we had just a short while ago.    
 This is over 5@@ 80@@ ,000 let@@ ters of genetic co@@ de@@ ; it's the larg@@ est mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le ever made by human@@ s of a defin@@ ed struc@@ ture.    
 It's over 3@@ 00 million mo@@ le@@ cu@@ lar we@@ i@@ ght.    
 If we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing, it takes 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ ages just to prin@@ t this genetic co@@ de.    
 Well, how do we boo@@ t up a chromos@@ ome@@ ? How do we ac@@ tiv@@ ate this?    
 O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly, with a vir@@ us it's pretty simp@@ le@@ ; it's much more complicated de@@ al@@ ing with bacteri@@ a.    
 It's also simp@@ l@@ er when you go into e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ o@@ tes like our@@ selv@@ es@@ : you can just po@@ p out the nuc@@ le@@ us and po@@ p in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with cl@@ on@@ ing.    
 With bacteri@@ a and Ar@@ cha@@ ea@@ , the chromos@@ ome is inte@@ gr@@ ated into the c@@ ell, but we rec@@ ently show@@ ed that we can do a comple@@ te transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromos@@ ome from one cell to another and ac@@ tiv@@ ate it.    
 We pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromos@@ ome from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- rou@@ gh@@ ly, these two are as dist@@ ant as human and m@@ ice -- we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tr@@ a gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ec@@ t for this chromos@@ om@@ e, we dig@@ es@@ ted it with en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es to kill all the prote@@ in@@ s, and it was pretty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- our very s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated graph@@ ics here. The new chromos@@ ome went into the cell@@ .    
 In fact, we thought this might be as far as it w@@ ent, but we tried to design the process a little bit f@@ ur@@ ther@@ .    
 This is a maj@@ or mechan@@ ism of evolution right here. We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromos@@ ome or a third one from some@@ wher@@ e, ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that speci@@ es.    
 So, people who think of evolution as just one gen@@ e changing at a time have mis@@ sed much of bio@@ log@@ y.    
 There are en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es called re@@ stri@@ c@@ tion en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es that actually dig@@ est DN@@ A@@ .    
 The chromos@@ ome that was in the cell doesn't have one@@ ; the chromos@@ ome we put in do@@ es.    
 It got ex@@ pres@@ sed and it recog@@ n@@ ized the other chromos@@ ome as fore@@ ign materi@@ al, ch@@ ew@@ ed it up, and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromos@@ om@@ e.    
 It turned bl@@ ue because of the gen@@ es we put in it.    
 And with a very short peri@@ od of time, all the charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of one species were lo@@ st and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that we put in the cell@@ .    
 All the prote@@ ins chan@@ ge@@ d, the memb@@ ran@@ es chan@@ ge@@ d@@ ; when we read the genetic co@@ de, it's exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in.    
 So, this may sound like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y, but we can@@ , by moving the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are of DN@@ A aroun@@ d, change things quite drama@@ tic@@ ally.    
 Now I've argu@@ ed, this is not gen@@ es@@ is@@ ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolu@@ tion.    
 And I've argu@@ ed that we're about to perhaps create a new ver@@ sion of the C@@ am@@ bri@@ an explo@@ sion, where there's mas@@ sive new speci@@ ation based on this digital desig@@ n.    
 Why do this?    
 I think this is pretty obvi@@ ous in terms of some of the need@@ s.    
 We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years.    
 To put it in cont@@ ext for my@@ self@@ : I was born in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ .    
 There are now three people on the plan@@ et for every one of us that exist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ ; within 40 years, ther@@ e@@ 'll be four@@ .    
 We have tr@@ ou@@ ble fe@@ ed@@ ing, provid@@ ing fre@@ sh@@ , clean wat@@ er, medic@@ in@@ es, fu@@ el for the six and a half billi@@ on.    
 It's going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ ine.    
 We use over five billion tons of co@@ al, 30 billi@@ on-@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of o@@ il -- that's a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day.    
 When we try to think of bio@@ logical process@@ es or any process to re@@ place that, it's going to be a huge challeng@@ e.    
 Then of course, there's all that CO2 from this materi@@ al that ends up in the at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ e.    
 We now, from our dis@@ co@@ very around the world, have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es, and I like to think of these as the design comp@@ on@@ ents of the fu@@ ture.    
 The elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics indu@@ str@@ y only had a do@@ z@@ en or so comp@@ on@@ ents, and look at the di@@ versity that came out of that.    
 We're lim@@ ited here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a bio@@ logical reality and our imagin@@ ation.    
 We now have techniqu@@ es, because of these ra@@ pi@@ d me@@ tho@@ ds of syn@@ thes@@ is, to do what we're call@@ ing comb@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al gen@@ om@@ ic@@ s.    
 We have the ability now to build a large robo@@ t that can make a million chromos@@ om@@ es a day.    
 When you think of process@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ tim@@ ize process@@ es to produce oc@@ t@@ an@@ e or to produce ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tic@@ als, new vacc@@ in@@ es, we can just with a small te@@ am, do more mo@@ le@@ cu@@ lar bio@@ logy than the last 20 years of all sci@@ ence.    
 And it's just stand@@ ard sel@@ ec@@ tion@@ : we can sel@@ ec@@ t for vi@@ ab@@ il@@ ity, chemical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion, vacc@@ ine produc@@ tion, et@@ c@@ .    
 This is a scre@@ en s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some tru@@ e design so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that we're working on to actually be able to s@@ it down and design species in the compu@@ ter.    
 You know, we don't know necess@@ arily what it@@ 'll look like@@ : we know exactly what their genetic code looks lik@@ e.    
 We're foc@@ using on now four@@ th@@ -@@ generation fuel@@ s.    
 You@@ 've seen rec@@ ent@@ ly, cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ o@@ l is just a bad experi@@ ment.    
 We have secon@@ d@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d-@@ generation fuel@@ s that will be coming out rela@@ tively soon that are su@@ gar@@ , to much high@@ er@@ -@@ value fuel@@ s like oc@@ t@@ an@@ e or different types of bu@@ t@@ an@@ ol@@ .    
 But the only way we think that bio@@ logy can have a maj@@ or impact without f@@ ur@@ ther increas@@ ing the cost of food and lim@@ iting its avail@@ ability is if we start with CO2 as its fe@@ ed@@ st@@ oc@@ k, and so we're working with desig@@ ning cell@@ s to go down this roa@@ d.    
 And we think we@@ 'll have the first four@@ th@@ -@@ generation fuel@@ s in about 1@@ 8 month@@ s.    
 S@@ un@@ light and CO2 is one me@@ th@@ od ...    
   but in our dis@@ co@@ very around the world, we have all kinds of other me@@ tho@@ ds.    
 This is an organ@@ ism we descri@@ bed in 19@@ 9@@ 6@@ .    
 It lives in the de@@ ep oce@@ an, about a mi@@ le and a half deep@@ , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water te@@ m@@ per@@ atu@@ re@@ s.    
 It takes CO2 to me@@ th@@ an@@ e using mo@@ le@@ cu@@ lar hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en as its energy sour@@ ce.    
 We're looking to see if we can take cap@@ ture@@ d CO@@ 2@@ , which can eas@@ ily be pi@@ ped to sit@@ es, conver@@ t that CO2 back into fu@@ el to dri@@ ve this proc@@ ess.    
 So, in a short peri@@ od of time, what the basic question is of "What is life@@ ?"    
 We tr@@ ul@@ y, you know, have mo@@ d@@ est go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tro@@ l@@ -@@ chemical indu@@ str@@ y -- Yea@@ h. If you can't do that at TED@@ , where can you@@ ? -- become a maj@@ or sour@@ ce of energy ...    
 But al@@ so, we're now working on using these same tools to come up with in@@ st@@ ant se@@ ts of vacc@@ in@@ es.    
 You@@ 've seen this year with flu@@ ; we're always a year behind and a dol@@ lar short when it comes to the right vacc@@ ine.    
 I think that can be changed by building comb@@ in@@ at@@ ori@@ al vacc@@ ines in adv@@ anc@@ e.    
 Here's what the future may begin to look like with chang@@ ing, now, the evolu@@ tionary tre@@ e, spe@@ e@@ ding up evolution with syn@@ the@@ tic bacteri@@ a, Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a and, even@@ tu@@ ally, e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ o@@ t@@ es.    
 We're a ways away from impro@@ ving people@@ : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survi@@ ve long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.    
 What I'm going to show you fir@@ st, as quick@@ ly as I can@@ , is some foun@@ da@@ tional work, some new technology that we brought to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft as part of an ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion almost exactly a year ago.    
 This is Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on, and it's an environment in which you can ei@@ ther loc@@ ally or re@@ mo@@ tely inter@@ act with v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of vi@@ su@@ al dat@@ a.    
 We're looking at man@@ y, many gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and contin@@ u@@ ously z@@ o@@ om@@ ing in, pan@@ ning through it, re@@ ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ing it in any way we wan@@ t.    
 And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the images are.    
 M@@ ost of them are ordinary digital camera photo@@ s, but this one, for example, is a s@@ can from the Li@@ br@@ ary of C@@ ong@@ res@@ s, and it's in the 3@@ 00 me@@ ga@@ pix@@ el ran@@ g@@ e.    
 It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to lim@@ it the perfor@@ man@@ ce of a system like this one is the number of pixel@@ s on your scre@@ en at any given mom@@ ent.    
 It's also very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble architec@@ ture.    
 This is an entire book, so this is an example of n@@ on-@@ image dat@@ a.    
 This is "@@ B@@ lea@@ k H@@ ou@@ se@@ " by D@@ ic@@ k@@ en@@ s. Every col@@ um@@ n is a cha@@ p@@ ter.    
 To pro@@ ve to you that it's really t@@ ex@@ t, and not an imag@@ e, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real represent@@ ation of the t@@ ex@@ t@@ ; it's not a pic@@ ture.    
 Maybe this is an arti@@ fic@@ ial way to read an e-@@ boo@@ k.    
 I wouldn't re@@ comm@@ end it.    
 This is a more real@@ istic case, an issu@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an.    
 Every large image is the beginning of a se@@ c@@ tion.    
 And this really gi@@ ves you the jo@@ y and the good experience of reading the real pa@@ per ver@@ sion of a mag@@ az@@ ine or a new@@ sp@@ a@@ per@@ , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi@@ -@@ scale kind of medi@@ u@@ m.    
 We've done something with the cor@@ ner of this particular issu@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an.    
 We've made up a fa@@ ke ad that's very high res@@ olu@@ tion -- much high@@ er than in an ordinary ad -- and we've em@@ be@@ dd@@ ed ex@@ tr@@ a cont@@ ent.    
 If you want to see the fe@@ atu@@ res of this car@@ , you can see it here.    
 Or other model@@ s, or even techni@@ cal speci@@ fi@@ ca@@ tions.    
 And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on scre@@ en real est@@ ate.    
 We hope that this means no more pop@@ -@@ up@@ s and other ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish like that -- sh@@ ouldn't be necess@@ ary.    
 O@@ f course, ma@@ pp@@ ing is one of those obvi@@ ous appli@@ cations for a technology like this.    
 And this one I really won@@ 't spend any time on, excep@@ t to say that we have things to con@@ tribu@@ te to this fiel@@ d as well.    
 But those are all the ro@@ ad@@ s in the U.S.    
 super@@ imp@@ osed on top of a N@@ A@@ S@@ A ge@@ os@@ pati@@ al imag@@ e.    
 So let's pul@@ l up, now, something el@@ se.    
 This is actually live on the We@@ b now@@ ; you can go chec@@ k it out.    
 This is a project called P@@ ho@@ t@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th, which mar@@ ri@@ es two different technologi@@ es.    
 One of them is Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful compu@@ ter@@ -@@ vi@@ sion research done by No@@ a@@ h S@@ na@@ vel@@ y, a gradu@@ ate stud@@ ent at the U@@ ni@@ versity of W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on, co@@ -@@ adv@@ is@@ ed by Ste@@ ve Se@@ it@@ z at U.@@ W@@ .    
 and R@@ ic@@ k S@@ z@@ e@@ li@@ sk@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch. A very n@@ ice collabor@@ ation.    
 And so this is live on the We@@ b@@ . It's power@@ ed by Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on.    
 You can see that when we do these sorts of view@@ s, where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi@@ -@@ res@@ olu@@ tion experienc@@ e.    
 But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment of the images here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful.    
 The computer vi@@ sion al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have re@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respon@@ d to the real space in which these sho@@ ts -- all taken near G@@ r@@ as@@ s@@ i L@@ a@@ kes in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies -- all these sho@@ ts were ta@@ k@@ en.    
 So you see el@@ em@@ ents here of st@@ ab@@ ili@@ zed sli@@ de@@ -@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing, and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally.    
 I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environ@@ ment@@ s.    
 Some are much more sp@@ ati@@ al.    
 I would like to ju@@ m@@ p stra@@ ight to one of No@@ a@@ h@@ 's or@@ ig@@ in@@ al dat@@ a@@ -@@ se@@ ts -- this is from an ear@@ ly pro@@ to@@ type that we first got working this sum@@ m@@ er -- to show you what I think is really the p@@ unch line behind the P@@ ho@@ t@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th technology, It's not necess@@ arily so app@@ aren@@ t from looking at the environ@@ ments we've put up on the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e.    
 We had to wor@@ ry about the law@@ y@@ ers and so on.    
 This is a re@@ construc@@ tion of No@@ t@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ d@@ ral that was done enti@@ rely compu@@ ta@@ tion@@ ally from images sc@@ ra@@ ped from F@@ lic@@ k@@ r.    
 You just type No@@ t@@ re D@@ ame into F@@ lic@@ k@@ r@@ , and you get some pictures of guys in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts, and of the camp@@ us and so on.    
 And each of these or@@ ange con@@ es re@@ pres@@ ents an image that was discover@@ ed to bel@@ ong to this model@@ .    
 And so these are all F@@ lic@@ k@@ r imag@@ es, and they@@ 've all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way.    
 We can just na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate in this very simple way.    
   You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ f@@ t.    
 It's very gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here.    
   I gu@@ ess you can see this is lots of different types of camer@@ as@@ : it's everything from cell@@ -@@ phone camer@@ as to prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s, quite a large number of them, sti@@ t@@ ched together in this environ@@ ment.    
 If I can find some of the sort of we@@ ird ones -- So many of them are oc@@ cl@@ u@@ ded by fac@@ es, and so on.    
 Some@@ where in here there is actually a ser@@ ies of photograph@@ s -- here we go.    
 This is actually a po@@ ster of No@@ t@@ re D@@ ame that re@@ gi@@ ster@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ly.    
 We can di@@ ve in from the po@@ ster to a physical view of this environ@@ ment.    
 What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environ@@ ment.    
 This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collec@@ tive memor@@ y, vi@@ su@@ ally, of what the Earth looks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together.    
 Th@@ ose photos become lin@@ ke@@ d, and they make something emerg@@ ent that's great@@ er than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts.    
 You have a model that emerg@@ es of the entire Ear@@ th.    
 Th@@ ink of this as the long ta@@ il to Ste@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ l@@ er@@ 's V@@ ir@@ tu@@ al Earth work.    
 And this is something that grow@@ s in comple@@ x@@ ity as people use it, and wh@@ ose bene@@ f@@ its become great@@ er to the us@@ ers as they use it.    
 The@@ ir own photos are getting ta@@ gg@@ ed with me@@ ta@@ -@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed.    
 If somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are, then my pho@@ to of No@@ t@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly gets en@@ ri@@ ched with all of that dat@@ a, and I can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that space, into that me@@ ta@@ -@@ ver@@ se, using everybody el@@ se@@ 's photo@@ s, and do a kind of a c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ mo@@ d@@ al and c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ us@@ er social experience that way.    
 And of course, a by@@ -@@ produc@@ t of all of that is im@@ men@@ sel@@ y rich virtu@@ al model@@ s of every interesting part of the Ear@@ th, collec@@ ted not just from over@@ head f@@ li@@ ghts and from s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite images and so on, but from the collec@@ tive memor@@ y.    
 Thank you so much.    
    Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : Do I understand this right?    
 What your so@@ f@@ tw@@ are is going to allow@@ , all the pictures that are sha@@ red by anyone across the world are going to lin@@ k together@@ ?    
 B@@ A@@ A: Y@@ es. What this is really doing is discover@@ ing, creating hy@@ per@@ lin@@ ks, if you will@@ , between imag@@ es.    
 It's doing that based on the cont@@ ent inside the imag@@ es.    
 And that gets really exc@@ iting when you think about the ri@@ ch@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information a lot of images ha@@ ve.    
 Li@@ ke when you do a we@@ b se@@ arch for imag@@ es, you type in ph@@ r@@ as@@ es, and the t@@ ext on the we@@ b p@@ age is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of information about what that picture is of.    
 What if that picture lin@@ ks to all of your pic@@ tu@@ res@@ ?    
 The amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connec@@ tion and ri@@ ch@@ ness that comes out of that is really hu@@ g@@ e.    
 It's a clas@@ si@@ c net@@ work effec@@ t.    
 CA: T@@ ru@@ ly incredi@@ b@@ le. C@@ ong@@ r@@ atu@@ la@@ tions.    
 You know, one of the in@@ ten@@ se ple@@ as@@ u@@ res of tra@@ vel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graph@@ ic research is the opportunity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ gotten the old wa@@ ys, who still feel their past in the win@@ d, tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ sh@@ ed by ra@@ in, ta@@ ste it in the b@@ it@@ ter lea@@ ves of plan@@ ts.    
 Just to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sha@@ man@@ s still jour@@ ney beyond the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ a@@ y, or the my@@ th@@ s of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ d@@ ers still res@@ on@@ ate with mean@@ ing, or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ a, the Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ su@@ e the b@@ re@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma@@ , is to really remember the cent@@ ral re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ log@@ y, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absolu@@ te sen@@ se, but is just one model of real@@ ity,    
 the consequ@@ ence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ e@@ age ma@@ de, al@@ be@@ it success@@ ful@@ ly, many gener@@ ations ago.    
 And of course, we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ a@@ tiv@@ es.    
 We're all bor@@ n. We all bring our children into the world.    
 We go through initi@@ ation r@@ it@@ es.    
 We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of dea@@ th, so it sh@@ ouldn't surpri@@ se us that we all s@@ ing, we all danc@@ e, we all have ar@@ t.    
 But what's interesting is the unique ca@@ d@@ ence of the s@@ ong, the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every cul@@ ture.    
 And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the fore@@ sts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o, or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in H@@ ai@@ ti@@ , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut deser@@ t of Nor@@ ther@@ n Ken@@ y@@ a, the C@@ ur@@ an@@ der@@ o in the moun@@ tain@@ s of the An@@ d@@ es, or a car@@ a@@ v@@ ans@@ er@@ a@@ i in the middle of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a -- this is inc@@ id@@ ent@@ ally the fel@@ low that I tra@@ vel@@ ed into the deser@@ t with a mon@@ th ago -- or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ a@@ k her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma@@ ,    
 Ever@@ es@@ t, the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world.    
 All of these peop@@ les teach us that there are other ways of be@@ ing, other ways of thinking, other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing your@@ self in the Ear@@ th.    
 And this is an idea@@ , if you think about it, can only f@@ ill you with hop@@ e.    
 Now, together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a we@@ b of spir@@ itu@@ al life and cul@@ tural life that en@@ velop@@ s the plane@@ t, and is as important to the well@@ -@@ being of the plan@@ et as in@@ de@@ ed is the bio@@ logical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ e.    
 And you might think of this cul@@ tural we@@ b of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here, and you might def@@ ine the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here as being the su@@ m to@@ tal of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ am@@ s, my@@ th@@ s, ide@@ as, inspi@@ ra@@ tions, intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagin@@ ation since the da@@ w@@ n of consciousness.    
 The eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here is human@@ it@@ y's great leg@@ ac@@ y.    
 It's the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qui@@ si@@ tive speci@@ es.    
 And just as the bi@@ os@@ ph@@ ere has been sever@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded, so too is the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here -- and, if any@@ thing, at a far great@@ er r@@ ate.    
 No bio@@ logi@@ sts, for example, would d@@ are sugg@@ est that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion because it simply is not tru@@ e, and yet that -- the most a@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of bio@@ logical di@@ versity -- sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely approach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ tim@@ istic scen@@ ari@@ o in the real@@ m of cul@@ tural di@@ vers@@ ity.    
 And the great indi@@ cat@@ or of that, of course, is language lo@@ s@@ s.    
 When each of you in this room were bor@@ n, there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages spo@@ ken on the planet.    
 Now, a language is not just a body of vo@@ ca@@ bul@@ ary or a set of gr@@ am@@ ma@@ tical rul@@ es.    
 A language is a fl@@ as@@ h of the human spir@@ it.    
 It's a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the materi@@ al world.    
 Every language is an ol@@ d-@@ grow@@ th fore@@ st of the min@@ d, a wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed, a thought, an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of spir@@ itu@@ al possibili@@ ties.    
 And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ag@@ es, as we s@@ it here today in M@@ on@@ ter@@ e@@ y, fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children@@ .    
 They're no longer being taught to b@@ ab@@ ies, which mean@@ s, effec@@ tiv@@ ely, un@@ less something chang@@ es, they're already dea@@ d.    
 What could be more l@@ on@@ ely than to be en@@ velop@@ ed in sil@@ ence, to be the last of your people to speak your langu@@ age, to have no way to pas@@ s on the wis@@ dom of the anc@@ es@@ tors or an@@ tici@@ p@@ ate the prom@@ ise of the children@@ ?    
 And ye@@ t, that d@@ read@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two wee@@ ks, because every two wee@@ ks, some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ l@@ lab@@ les of an ancient ton@@ gu@@ e.    
 And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be bet@@ ter, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spo@@ ke one langu@@ a@@ ge@@ ?" And I say, "@@ Gre@@ at, let's make that language Yor@@ u@@ b@@ a. Let's make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ es@@ e.    
 Let's make it K@@ o@@ gi@@ ."    
 And you'll suddenly dis@@ co@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own langu@@ age.    
 And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here, a bri@@ ef jour@@ ney through the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lo@@ st.    
 Now, there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say "@@ different ways of be@@ ing@@ ," I really do mean different ways of be@@ ing.    
 T@@ ak@@ e, for example, this child of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on, the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ d@@ a who believe that my@@ tho@@ log@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ na@@ k@@ es.    
 Now, this is a people who cog@@ ni@@ tively do not dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish the color bl@@ ue from the color gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the hea@@ ven@@ s is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the fore@@ st up@@ on which the people dep@@ en@@ d.    
 They have a curi@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called "@@ l@@ ing@@ u@@ istic ex@@ o@@ gam@@ y@@ :@@ " you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different langu@@ age.    
 And this is all roo@@ ted in the my@@ tho@@ logical pa@@ st, yet the curi@@ ous thing is in these long hous@@ es, where there are six or seven langu@@ ages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age, you never hear anyone prac@@ tic@@ ing a langu@@ age.    
 They simply list@@ en and then begin to spea@@ k.    
 O@@ r@@ , one of the most fascin@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever li@@ ved with@@ , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or, an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ace@@ fully in 19@@ 5@@ 8@@ .    
 In 19@@ 5@@ 7@@ , five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies at@@ temp@@ ted cont@@ act and made a cri@@ tical mista@@ k@@ e.    
 They dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ s@@ s@@ y photograph@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly g@@ es@@ tures, for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ fore@@ st had never seen anything tw@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al in their lives.    
 They pic@@ ked up these photograph@@ s from the fore@@ st flo@@ or, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figu@@ re, found no@@ thing, and con@@ cl@@ u@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ v@@ il, so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies to dea@@ th.    
 But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn't just spe@@ ar out@@ sid@@ ers.    
 They spe@@ ared each other.    
 5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them spe@@ aring each other.    
 We trac@@ ed gene@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back eight gener@@ a@@ tions, and we found two instan@@ ces of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it, they adm@@ it@@ ted that one of the fel@@ low@@ s had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we spe@@ ared him any@@ way. But at the same time they had a per@@ spi@@ ca@@ ci@@ ous knowledge of the fore@@ st that was ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing.    
 The@@ ir hun@@ ters could sm@@ ell ani@@ mal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it beh@@ in@@ d.    
 In the ear@@ ly '@@ 80@@ s, I had a really ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing assig@@ n@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interested in going down to H@@ ai@@ ti@@ , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secre@@ t socie@@ ties which were the foun@@ da@@ tion of D@@ u@@ val@@ i@@ er@@ 's st@@ ren@@ g@@ th and T@@ on@@ t@@ on M@@ ac@@ out@@ es, and se@@ cur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es.    
 In order to make sense out of sen@@ sa@@ tion, of course, I had to understand something about this re@@ mar@@ k@@ able fa@@ ith of V@@ o@@ d@@ oun@@ . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t.    
 On the con@@ tr@@ ar@@ y, it's a complex me@@ ta@@ physical world@@ view@@ . It's interes@@ t@@ ing.    
 If I asked you to name the great reli@@ gi@@ ons of the world, what would you sa@@ y?    
 Ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity, I@@ s@@ l@@ am, Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ism, J@@ u@@ da@@ ism, what@@ ever@@ .    
 There's always one contin@@ ent left out, the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Afri@@ c@@ a had no reli@@ gi@@ ous beli@@ e@@ f@@ s. Well, of course, they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the di@@ sti@@ l@@ la@@ tion of these very pro@@ found reli@@ gi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sla@@ very er@@ a.    
 But, what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dea@@ d.    
 So, the living give bir@@ th to the spir@@ it@@ s.    
 The spir@@ its can be inv@@ o@@ ked from bene@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ at@@ er, respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ ent@@ arily disp@@ l@@ ace the sou@@ l of the liv@@ ing, so that for that bri@@ ef sh@@ ining mom@@ ent, the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te becomes the go@@ d.    
 That's why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that "@@ You white people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and speak about Go@@ d.    
 We d@@ ance in the temp@@ le and become Go@@ d@@ ."    
 And because you are pos@@ ses@@ se@@ d, you are taken by the spi@@ rit -- how can you be har@@ me@@ d?    
 So you see these ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion@@ s: V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ b@@ ers with imp@@ un@@ ity, a rather ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the ability of the mind to affec@@ t the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of ex@@ tre@@ me exc@@ it@@ ation.    
 Now, of all the peop@@ les that I've ever been with@@ , the most extraordinary are the K@@ o@@ g@@ i of the Si@@ er@@ r@@ a N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ ant@@ a M@@ ar@@ t@@ a in nor@@ ther@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a.    
 which once car@@ pe@@ ted the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a, in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ ques@@ t, these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ars abo@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in.    
 In a bloo@@ d@@ stain@@ ed contin@@ ent, these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh@@ .    
 To this day, they re@@ main rul@@ ed by a r@@ itu@@ al pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the tra@@ ining for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather extra@@ ordin@@ ary.    
 The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four@@ , se@@ ques@@ tered in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the bas@@ e of g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 1@@ 8 year@@ s: two n@@ ine@@ -@@ year peri@@ o@@ ds deli@@ ber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to mi@@ mi@@ c the nine months of g@@ es@@ ta@@ tion they spend in their natural mother@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ; now they are me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother@@ .    
 And for this entire time, they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the valu@@ es of their societ@@ y, valu@@ es that main@@ tain the pro@@ posi@@ tion that their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers and their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers alone main@@ tain the c@@ os@@ mi@@ c -- or we might say the ec@@ o@@ logical -- bal@@ anc@@ e.    
 And at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their liv@@ es, at the age of 1@@ 8@@ , they see a sun@@ ri@@ se. And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ wa@@ ren@@ ess of first light as the Su@@ n beg@@ ins to ba@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es suddenly everything they have learned in the ab@@ str@@ act is aff@@ ir@@ med in st@@ un@@ ning g@@ l@@ or@@ y. And the pri@@ est st@@ ep@@ s back and says, "@@ You see@@ ? It's really as I've told you.    
 It is that beauti@@ ful. It is your@@ s to prote@@ c@@ t@@ ."    
 They call themselves the "@@ el@@ der bro@@ ther@@ s@@ " are the ones respon@@ sible for des@@ tro@@ ying the world.    
 Now, this level of intui@@ tion becomes very import@@ ant.    
 Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and lan@@ ds@@ cap@@ e, we ei@@ ther inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the "@@ no@@ ble sa@@ va@@ ge@@ ," which is an idea rac@@ ist in its simp@@ lic@@ ity, or alter@@ na@@ tiv@@ ely, we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ o@@ rea@@ u and say these people are clo@@ s@@ er to the Earth than we are.    
 Well, indi@@ gen@@ ous people are nei@@ ther sen@@ tim@@ ent@@ al no@@ r we@@ ak@@ ened by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a.    
 There's not a lot of room for ei@@ ther in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ be@@ t, but they ha@@ ve, ne@@ ver@@ the@@ l@@ ess, through time and r@@ itu@@ al, for@@ ged a tra@@ di@@ tional my@@ sti@@ qu@@ e of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ conscious@@ ly close to it, but on a far sub@@ t@@ l@@ er intui@@ tion@@ : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human consciousness.    
 Now, what does that mean@@ ?    
 It means that a young kid from the An@@ des who's rais@@ ed to believe that that moun@@ tain is an A@@ p@@ u spi@@ rit that will direc@@ t his or her des@@ tiny will be a prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resour@@ ce or that place than a young kid from M@@ on@@ t@@ an@@ a rais@@ ed to believe that a moun@@ tain is a pi@@ le of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed.    
 Wh@@ e@@ ther it's the abo@@ de of a spi@@ rit or a pi@@ le of or@@ e is ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant.    
 What's interesting is the me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world.    
 I was rais@@ ed in the fore@@ sts of B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h C@@ olu@@ m@@ bi@@ a to believe those fore@@ sts exist@@ ed to be cu@@ t.    
 than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those fore@@ sts were the abo@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ roo@@ ked B@@ ea@@ k of H@@ ea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ bal spir@@ its that d@@ well@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world, spir@@ its they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a initi@@ ation.    
 Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different real@@ i@@ ties, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discover@@ ies. T@@ a@@ ke this plant here.    
 It's a photo@@ gra@@ p@@ h I took in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ p@@ r@@ il.    
 This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca, which many of you have heard ab@@ out, the most powerful psycho@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ par@@ ation of the sha@@ man@@ 's re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re.    
 What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ c@@ a fascin@@ ating is not the she@@ er ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ o@@ logical potential of this pre@@ par@@ ation, but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it. It's made really of two different sour@@ c@@ es@@ : on the one han@@ d, this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a ser@@ ies of be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es, har@@ min@@ e, har@@ mal@@ ine, mil@@ d@@ ly h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of bl@@ ue ha@@ z@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness -- but it's mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e family    
 This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es, very close to brain ser@@ o@@ ton@@ in, di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine, 5@@ -@@ me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine. If you've ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i b@@ low@@ ing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ s@@ es, that sub@@ stan@@ ce they make from a different set of species also con@@ tain@@ s me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine. To have that pow@@ der b@@ low@@ n up your no@@ se is rather like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ qu@@ e pain@@ t@@ ings and lan@@ ding on a se@@ a of elec@@ tric@@ ity.     
 It doesn't create the di@@ stor@@ tion of real@@ it@@ y@@ ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ solu@@ tion of real@@ ity.    
 In fact, I used to argu@@ e with my prof@@ ess@@ or, Ri@@ ch@@ ard E@@ v@@ an Sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c er@@ a with his dis@@ co@@ very of the magic mus@@ h@@ room@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s -- I used to argu@@ e that you couldn't clas@@ si@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines as h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you're under the effec@@ ts there's no one home any@@ more to experience a h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation. But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally    
 because they're den@@ atu@@ red by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found n@@ atur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ x@@ id@@ as@@ e.    
 They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other chemical that den@@ atu@@ res the M@@ A@@ O@@ .    
 Now, the fascin@@ ating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ors of the pre@@ ci@@ se sort necess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine. So you ask your@@ self a ques@@ tion.    
 H@@ ow, in a fl@@ or@@ a of 80@@ ,000 species of v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar plan@@ ts, do these people find these two mor@@ pho@@ log@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated plan@@ ts that when comb@@ ined in this way, of the whole being great@@ er than the su@@ m of the part@@ s?    
 Well, we use that great e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ ism, "@@ tri@@ al and er@@ ror@@ ," which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be mean@@ ing@@ l@@ ess.    
 But you ask the Indi@@ an@@ s, and they say, "The plan@@ ts talk to us@@ ."    
 Well, what does that mean@@ ?    
 This tri@@ be, the C@@ of@@ an, has 1@@ 7 vari@@ e@@ ties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca, all of which they dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish a great di@@ stan@@ ce in the fore@@ st, all of which are ref@@ er@@ able to our ey@@ e as one speci@@ es.    
 And then you ask them how they es@@ tab@@ lish their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say, "I thought you knew something about plan@@ ts.    
 I mean, don't you know any@@ thing@@ ?" And I said, "@@ No@@ ."    
 Well, it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 vari@@ e@@ ties in the ni@@ ght of a full mo@@ on, and it sing@@ s to you in a different ke@@ y.    
 Now, that's not going to get you a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d, but it's a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ en@@ s. Now -- -- sy@@ mp@@ a@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ ain@@ t and color@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world, mean@@ ing our world, mo@@ ves on.    
 Well, the truth is the 20@@ th centur@@ y, 3@@ 00 years from now, is not going to be rememb@@ ered for its war@@ s or its techno@@ logical inno@@ va@@ tions, and ei@@ ther ac@@ tively end@@ or@@ sed or pas@@ si@@ vel@@ y acc@@ ep@@ ted the mas@@ sive des@@ truc@@ tion of both bio@@ logical and cul@@ tural di@@ versity on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.    
 All cul@@ tures through all time have con@@ stan@@ tly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new possibili@@ ties of life.    
 And the problem is not technology it@@ self.    
 The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ row any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ gg@@ y.    
 It's not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ en@@ s the inte@@ gr@@ ity of the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here. It is pow@@ er, the cru@@ de face of dom@@ in@@ ation.    
 Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world, you dis@@ co@@ ver that these are not cul@@ tures des@@ t@@ ined to f@@ ad@@ e a@@ wa@@ y@@ ; these are dy@@ nam@@ ic living peop@@ les being dri@@ ven out of exist@@ ence by identi@@ fi@@ able forc@@ es that are beyond their cap@@ ac@@ ity to adap@@ t to@@ : whether it's the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ fore@@ st@@ ation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an -- a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a, from S@@ ar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who li@@ ved free in the fore@@ st until a generation ago,    
 and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to ser@@ v@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ stitu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s, where you can see the ri@@ ver itself is so@@ il@@ ed with the sil@@ t that seems to be car@@ r@@ ying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the South Chin@@ a S@@ ea@@ , where the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese fre@@ i@@ gh@@ ters han@@ g light in the hor@@ iz@@ on ready to f@@ ill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w log@@ s ri@@ pped from the fore@@ st -- or, in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i@@ ,    
 it's the dise@@ ase enti@@ ties that have come in, in the wa@@ ke of the dis@@ co@@ very of go@@ l@@ d.    
 Or if we go into the moun@@ tain@@ s of T@@ i@@ be@@ t, where I'm doing a lot of research rec@@ ent@@ ly, you'll see it's a cru@@ de face of political dom@@ in@@ ation.    
 You know, gen@@ oc@@ id@@ e, the physical ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion of a people is uni@@ vers@@ ally con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, but eth@@ no@@ c@@ id@@ e, the des@@ truc@@ tion of people@@ 's way of life, is not only not con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, it's uni@@ vers@@ ally, in many quar@@ ters, c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated as part of a development str@@ at@@ eg@@ y.    
 And you cannot understand the pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t until you move through it at the grou@@ nd level@@ .    
 I once tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in W@@ es@@ ter@@ n Chin@@ a over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n T@@ i@@ be@@ t to L@@ ha@@ s@@ a with a young colleag@@ u@@ e, and it was only when I got to L@@ ha@@ s@@ a that I underst@@ ood the face behind the sta@@ tis@@ tics you hear ab@@ out@@ : 6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ u@@ ments tor@@ n a@@ part to d@@ ust and ash@@ es, 1@@ .@@ 2 million people killed by the ca@@ d@@ res during the C@@ ul@@ tural R@@ evolu@@ tion.    
 This young man@@ 's father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ ama@@ .    
 That me@@ ant he was instan@@ tly killed at the time of the Chinese inv@@ as@@ i@@ on.    
 H@@ is un@@ cle fl@@ ed with H@@ is Hol@@ iness in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to N@@ ep@@ al.    
 H@@ is mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ th@@ y.    
 He was sm@@ u@@ gg@@ led into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to h@@ ide bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn't be@@ ar to be without him.    
 The si@@ ster who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an edu@@ cation camp@@ .    
 One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an ar@@ mb@@ and of Ma@@ o, and for that trans@@ gres@@ sion, she was given seven years of hard lab@@ or.    
 The pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t can be impos@@ sible to be@@ ar, but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spi@@ rit of the people is something to beh@@ ol@@ d.    
 And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choic@@ e: do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chrom@@ a@@ tic world of mon@@ o@@ ton@@ y or do we want to em@@ br@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ chrom@@ a@@ tic world of di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y?    
 M@@ ar@@ g@@ are@@ t M@@ ea@@ d, the great an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logi@@ st, said, before she di@@ ed, that her greatest fe@@ ar was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this b@@ lan@@ d@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire ran@@ ge of the human imagin@@ ation re@@ duc@@ ed to a more nar@@ row mo@@ d@@ ality of thought, but that we would wa@@ ke from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibili@@ ties.    
 And it's hu@@ mb@@ ling to remember that our species ha@@ s, perha@@ ps, been around for [@@ 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,00@@ 0@@ ] years.    
 The N@@ e@@ o@@ li@@ thi@@ c R@@ evolution -- which gave us ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture, at which time we su@@ c@@ cu@@ mb@@ ed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed@@ ; the po@@ e@@ try of the sha@@ man was disp@@ l@@ ac@@ ed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ oo@@ d@@ ; we created hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y speci@@ al@@ iz@@ ation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 10@@ ,000 years ago.    
 The moder@@ n indu@@ stri@@ al world as we know it is b@@ are@@ ly 3@@ 00 years ol@@ d.    
 Now, that sh@@ allow history doesn't sugg@@ est to me that we have all the answ@@ ers for all of the challeng@@ es that will conf@@ ront us in the en@@ su@@ ing m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a.    
 When these my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world are asked the mean@@ ing of being human@@ , they respon@@ d with 10@@ ,000 different voic@@ es.    
 And it's within that s@@ ong that we will all re@@ dis@@ co@@ ver the possib@@ ility of being what we are@@ : a fully consci@@ ous speci@@ es, fully aw@@ are of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ . And there are great moments of op@@ tim@@ ism.    
 This is a photo@@ gra@@ p@@ h I took at the nor@@ ther@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in I@@ s@@ land when I went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people, and this man, O@@ lay@@ u@@ k, told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father@@ .    
 The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an government has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people, and during the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s, to es@@ tab@@ lish our so@@ ver@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty, we forced them into se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment@@ s.    
 This old man@@ 's grand@@ father ref@@ used to go.    
 The family, fear@@ ful for his life, took away all of his we@@ ap@@ on@@ s, all of his tool@@ s.    
 Now, you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fe@@ ar the col@@ d@@ ; they took adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of it.    
 The run@@ n@@ ers of their sle@@ ds were or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally made of fish w@@ ra@@ pped in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou h@@ id@@ e.    
 So, this man@@ 's grand@@ father was not in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic ni@@ ght or the b@@ li@@ z@@ z@@ ard that was b@@ low@@ ing.    
 He simply sli@@ pped out@@ sid@@ e, pul@@ led down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ fec@@ ated into his han@@ d. And as the fec@@ es began to free@@ z@@ e, he sha@@ ped it into the form of a b@@ la@@ de.    
 He put a sp@@ ra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ v@@ a on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it finally f@@ ro@@ ze so@@ li@@ d, he bu@@ t@@ ch@@ ered a do@@ g with it.    
 He sk@@ in@@ ned the do@@ g and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness, took the ri@@ b@@ ca@@ ge of the do@@ g and impro@@ vis@@ ed a sle@@ d, har@@ n@@ ess@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g, and disap@@ pe@@ ared over the ice flo@@ es, sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in bel@@ t.    
 T@@ al@@ k about getting by with no@@ thing. And this, in many ways -- -- is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the re@@ si@@ li@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world.    
 The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an government in A@@ pri@@ l of 19@@ 9@@ 9 gave back to to@@ tal control of the In@@ u@@ it an area of land larg@@ er than Californi@@ a and T@@ ex@@ as put together.    
 It's our new hom@@ el@@ an@@ d. It's called N@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ u@@ t.    
 It's an in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y. They control all min@@ er@@ al resour@@ c@@ es.    
 A@@ n amazing example of how a na@@ tion@@ -@@ state can see@@ k res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion with its people.    
 And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvi@@ ous at least to all of all us who@@ 've tra@@ vel@@ ed in these re@@ mo@@ te reach@@ es of the plane@@ t, to realize that they're not re@@ mo@@ te at all.    
 They're hom@@ el@@ ands of some@@ bod@@ y.    
 They re@@ present bran@@ ch@@ es of the human imagin@@ ation that go back to the da@@ w@@ n of time. And for all of us, the dre@@ ams of these children, like the dre@@ ams of our own children, become part of the na@@ ked ge@@ o@@ graph@@ y of hop@@ e.    
 So, what we're trying to do at the Na@@ tional G@@ e@@ o@@ graph@@ ic, finally, is, we believe that poli@@ tici@@ ans will never ac@@ comp@@ lish any@@ thing.    
 We think that po@@ le@@ mic@@ s -- -- we think that po@@ le@@ mic@@ s are not per@@ su@@ as@@ i@@ ve, but we think that stor@@ y@@ telling can change the world, and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ telling in@@ stitu@@ tion in the world. We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our we@@ b@@ s@@ ite every mon@@ th.    
 1@@ 5@@ 6 na@@ tions car@@ ry our tel@@ e@@ vi@@ sion chan@@ n@@ el@@ .    
 Our mag@@ az@@ ines are read by milli@@ on@@ s.    
 And what we're doing is a ser@@ ies of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sp@@ here where we're going to take our audi@@ ence to places of such cul@@ tural won@@ der that they cannot help but come away da@@ z@@ z@@ led em@@ br@@ ace gradu@@ ally, one by one, that this world deser@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a di@@ ver@@ se way, that we can find a way to live in a truly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al, pl@@ ur@@ al@@ istic world where all of the wis@@ dom of all peop@@ les can con@@ tribu@@ te to our collec@@ tive well@@ -@@ be@@ ing.    
 Thank you very much.    
 I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of m@@ ine that I hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you've already hear@@ d, and I'll try to make some connec@@ tions my@@ self, in case you mis@@ sed them.    
 But I want to start with what I call the "@@ offic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma@@ ."    
 The offic@@ ial do@@ g@@ m@@ a of what@@ ?    
 The offic@@ ial do@@ g@@ m@@ a of all W@@ es@@ ter@@ n indu@@ stri@@ al socie@@ ties.    
 And the offic@@ ial do@@ g@@ m@@ a run@@ s like this: if we are interested in maxim@@ izing the w@@ el@@ f@@ are of our citi@@ zen@@ s, the way to do that is to maxim@@ ize individual fre@@ ed@@ om@@ .    
 The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself goo@@ d, valu@@ able, wor@@ th@@ whi@@ le, ess@@ ential to being human@@ .    
 And because if people have fre@@ ed@@ om@@ , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maxim@@ ize our w@@ el@@ fa@@ re, and no one has to dec@@ ide on our be@@ hal@@ f@@ .    
 The way to maxim@@ ize freedom is to maxim@@ ize choic@@ e.    
 The more choice people ha@@ ve, the more freedom they ha@@ ve, and the more freedom they ha@@ ve, the more w@@ el@@ f@@ are they ha@@ ve.    
 Th@@ is, I think, is so deep@@ ly em@@ be@@ dd@@ ed in the water supp@@ ly that it wouldn't oc@@ cu@@ r to anyone to question it.    
 And it's also deep@@ ly em@@ be@@ dd@@ ed in our lives.    
 I'll give you some exam@@ ples of what moder@@ n progres@@ s has made possible for us.    
 This is my super@@ marke@@ t. Not such a big one.    
 I want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ing.    
 1@@ 7@@ 5 sal@@ ad dres@@ sing@@ s in my super@@ marke@@ t, if you don't coun@@ t the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 1@@ 2 bal@@ sam@@ ic v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dres@@ sing@@ s, in the off@@ -@@ chance that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the store has on offer su@@ it you.    
 So this is what the super@@ marke@@ t is lik@@ e.    
 And then you go to the con@@ sum@@ er elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics store to set up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- spea@@ k@@ ers, C@@ D play@@ er, ta@@ pe play@@ er, tun@@ er, am@@ p@@ li@@ fi@@ er -- and in this one single con@@ sum@@ er elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics store@@ , there are that many ster@@ e@@ o system@@ s. We can construc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ -@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o systems out of the comp@@ on@@ ents that are on offer in one store@@ .    
 You@@ 've got to adm@@ it that's a lot of choic@@ e.    
 In other dom@@ ain@@ s -- the world of communi@@ ca@@ tions.    
 There was a time, when I was a bo@@ y, when you could get any kind of tel@@ e@@ phone ser@@ vice you wan@@ ted, as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell@@ .    
 You ren@@ ted your ph@@ one. You didn't buy it.    
 One consequ@@ ence of that, by the way, is that the phone never bro@@ k@@ e.    
 And those days are g@@ one.    
 We now have an almost un@@ lim@@ ited vari@@ e@@ ty of ph@@ on@@ es, especially in the world of cell ph@@ on@@ es.    
 These are cell ph@@ ones of the fu@@ ture.    
 My favorite is the middle one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er, no@@ se ha@@ ir tri@@ mm@@ er, and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch. And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store ye@@ t, you can rest as@@ su@@ red that one day so@@ on, you will@@ .    
 And what this does is it lead@@ s people to walk into their store@@ s asking this ques@@ tion.    
 And do you know what the answer to this question now is@@ ?    
 The answer is "@@ no@@ ."    
 It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.    
 So, in other as@@ pec@@ ts of life that are much more signific@@ ant than bu@@ ying things, the same explo@@ sion of choice is tru@@ e.    
 H@@ e@@ al@@ th ca@@ re. It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doc@@ tor@@ , and the doctor tel@@ ls you what to do.    
 Instea@@ d, you go to the doc@@ tor@@ , and the doctor tel@@ ls you, "Well, we could do A@@ , or we could do B@@ .    
 A has these bene@@ f@@ it@@ s, and these risk@@ s.    
 B has these bene@@ f@@ it@@ s, and these risk@@ s. What do you want to do@@ ?"    
 And you say, "D@@ oc@@ , what should I do@@ ?"    
 And the do@@ c says, "@@ A has these bene@@ f@@ its and risk@@ s, and B has these bene@@ f@@ its and risk@@ s.    
 What do you want to do@@ ?"    
 And you say, "@@ If you were me, D@@ oc@@ , what would you do@@ ?"    
 And the do@@ c says, "@@ But I'm not you@@ ."    
 And the result is -- we call it "@@ pati@@ ent au@@ ton@@ om@@ y@@ ," which makes it sound like a good thing, but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the bur@@ d@@ en and the respon@@ sib@@ ility for deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely, the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sic@@ k and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely, the pati@@ ent.    
 There's en@@ or@@ m@@ ous marke@@ ting of pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion d@@ ru@@ g@@ s to people like you and me, whi@@ ch, if you think about it, makes no sense at all, since we can't buy them.    
 Why do they marke@@ t to us if we can't buy them@@ ?    
 The answer is that they ex@@ pect us to call our doc@@ tors the next mor@@ ning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be chan@@ ge@@ d.    
 Some@@ thing as drama@@ tic as our identity has now become a matter of choic@@ e, as this sli@@ de is me@@ ant to indi@@ cat@@ e.    
 We don't in@@ her@@ it an identi@@ ty@@ ; we get to inv@@ ent it.    
 And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we lik@@ e.    
 And that means that every day, when you wa@@ ke up in the morning, you have to dec@@ ide what kind of person you want to be.    
 With res@@ pect to mar@@ ri@@ age and family, there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ult as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you cou@@ l@@ d, and then you started having kids as soon as you cou@@ l@@ d.    
 The only real choice was wh@@ o, not wh@@ en, and not what you did af@@ ter.    
 No@@ wa@@ days, everything is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s.    
 I teach wonder@@ fully intellig@@ ent stud@@ ents, and I assig@@ n 20 percent less work than I used to.    
 And it's not because they're less smar@@ t, and it's not because they're less di@@ lig@@ ent.    
 It's because they are pre@@ oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ ed, asking them@@ selv@@ es, "@@ Sh@@ ould I get married or no@@ t? Sh@@ ould I get married now@@ ?    
 Sh@@ ould I get married lat@@ er@@ ? Sh@@ ould I have kids fir@@ st, or a care@@ er fir@@ st@@ ?"    
 All of these are con@@ sum@@ ing ques@@ tions.    
 And they're going to answer these ques@@ tions, whether or not it means not doing all the work I assig@@ n and not getting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ s@@ es.    
 And in@@ de@@ ed they sh@@ oul@@ d. These are important questions to answ@@ er.    
 Wor@@ k -- we are bl@@ es@@ se@@ d, as C@@ ar@@ l was poin@@ ting out, with the technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every min@@ u@@ te of every day from any place on the plan@@ et -- excep@@ t the R@@ an@@ dol@@ p@@ h H@@ o@@ tel@@ .    
     There is one cor@@ n@@ er, by the way, that I'm not going to tell anybody ab@@ out, where the Wi@@ F@@ i actually work@@ s.    
 I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it. So what this mean@@ s, this incredi@@ ble freedom of choice we have with res@@ pect to work, is that we have to make a deci@@ sion, again and again and again, about whether we should or sh@@ ouldn't be work@@ ing.    
 We can go to watch our kid play so@@ cc@@ er, and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p, and our B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p, and our la@@ p@@ top@@ , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ b@@ ly, on our la@@ p@@ s.    
 And even if they're all sh@@ ut off@@ , every min@@ u@@ te that we're watching our kid mu@@ til@@ ate a so@@ cc@@ er gam@@ e, we are also asking our@@ selv@@ es, "@@ Sh@@ ould I answer this cell phone call@@ ?    
 Sh@@ ould I respon@@ d to this e@@ ma@@ il@@ ? Sh@@ ould I dra@@ ft this let@@ ter@@ ?"    
 And even if the answer to the question is "@@ no@@ ," it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid@@ 's so@@ cc@@ er game very different than it w@@ oul@@ d@@ 've be@@ en.    
 So every@@ where we loo@@ k, big things and small things, materi@@ al things and lif@@ es@@ ty@@ le things, life is a matter of choic@@ e.    
 And the world we used to live in looked like this.    
 [@@ Well, actu@@ ally, they are writ@@ ten in st@@ one@@ .@@ ] That is to say, there were some choic@@ es, but not everything was a matter of choic@@ e.    
 And the world we now live in looks like this.    
 And the question is, is this good new@@ s, or bad new@@ s?    
 And the answer is, "@@ y@@ es@@ ."    
   We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.    
 All of this choice has two effec@@ ts, two nega@@ tive effec@@ ts on people.    
 One effec@@ t, par@@ a@@ do@@ x@@ ic@@ ally, is that it produc@@ es par@@ aly@@ si@@ s, rather than li@@ ber@@ ation.    
 With so many op@@ tions to choose from@@ , people find it very difficult to choose at all.    
 I'll give you one very drama@@ tic example of this: a study that was done of inv@@ est@@ ments in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment plan@@ s.    
 A colleag@@ ue of m@@ ine got acc@@ ess to inv@@ est@@ ment rec@@ or@@ ds from V@@ an@@ gu@@ ar@@ d, the gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic mu@@ tu@@ al@@ -@@ fu@@ nd company of about a million emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different work@@ plac@@ es.    
 And what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tu@@ al fun@@ ds the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er offer@@ ed, r@@ ate of partici@@ pa@@ tion went down two perc@@ ent.    
 You offer 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ w@@ er emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es partici@@ p@@ ate than if you only offer fi@@ ve. Wh@@ y?    
 Because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from@@ , it's so d@@ am@@ n hard to dec@@ ide which fu@@ nd to choos@@ e, that you'll just put it off until tom@@ or@@ row@@ .    
 And then tom@@ or@@ row@@ , and tom@@ or@@ row@@ , and tom@@ or@@ row@@ , and of course tom@@ or@@ row never com@@ es.    
 Un@@ der@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to e@@ at do@@ g food when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the deci@@ sion is so hard that they pas@@ s up signific@@ ant mat@@ ching money from the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er.    
 By not partici@@ pat@@ ing, they are pas@@ sing up as much as 5@@ ,000 dollars a year from the emp@@ lo@@ y@@ er, who would happ@@ ily mat@@ ch their con@@ tribu@@ tion.    
 So par@@ aly@@ sis is a consequ@@ ence of having too many choic@@ es.    
 And I think it makes the world look like this.    
 [@@ And la@@ st@@ ly, for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity, F@@ ren@@ ch, b@@ le@@ u che@@ es@@ e, or ran@@ ch@@ ?@@ ] You really want to get the deci@@ sion right if it's for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity, right?    
 You don't want to pick the wrong mu@@ tu@@ al fun@@ d, or the wrong sal@@ ad dres@@ s@@ ing.    
 So that's one effec@@ t. The second effec@@ t is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ aly@@ sis and make a choic@@ e, we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fe@@ w@@ er op@@ tions to choose from@@ .    
 And there are several reas@@ ons for this.    
 One of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dres@@ sing@@ s to choose from@@ , if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and what sal@@ ad dres@@ sing is@@ ? -- it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better.    
 And what happens is this imagin@@ ed alter@@ na@@ tive in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the deci@@ sion you ma@@ de, and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ trac@@ ts from the satis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the deci@@ sion you ma@@ de, even if it was a good deci@@ sion.    
 The more op@@ tions there are, the eas@@ i@@ er it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is disap@@ poin@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ os@@ e.    
 S@@ econ@@ d, what econom@@ ists call "@@ opportunity co@@ st@@ s."    
 D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big point this mor@@ ning of talking about how much the way in which we value things dep@@ ends on what we comp@@ are them to.    
 Well, when there are lots of alter@@ na@@ tiv@@ es to consid@@ er, it is easy to imagine the at@@ trac@@ tive fe@@ atu@@ res of alter@@ na@@ tiv@@ es that you re@@ jec@@ t that make you less satis@@ fied with the alter@@ na@@ tive that you've ch@@ os@@ en.    
 Here's an examp@@ le.    
 [@@ I can't stop thinking about those other avail@@ able par@@ king spac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th stre@@ et@@ ] S@@ or@@ ry if you're not New Yor@@ k@@ ers.    
 Here's what you're supposed to be thin@@ king.    
 Here's this couple on the H@@ am@@ p@@ ton@@ s.    
 V@@ ery exp@@ en@@ sive real est@@ ate.    
 G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach@@ . B@@ ea@@ u@@ ti@@ ful day. They have it all to them@@ selves.    
 What could be bet@@ ter@@ ?    
 "Well, d@@ am@@ n it@@ ," this guy is thinking, "@@ It's A@@ u@@ gu@@ st. Every@@ body in my Man@@ h@@ att@@ an neighbor@@ hood is a@@ way.    
 I could be par@@ king right in front of my build@@ ing@@ ."    
 And he sp@@ ends two weeks n@@ ag@@ ged by the idea that he is mis@@ sing the opportun@@ ity, day after day, to have a great par@@ king spac@@ e.    
 O@@ pp@@ or@@ tun@@ ity co@@ sts sub@@ tr@@ act from the satis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we choos@@ e, even when what we choose is terri@@ fic@@ .    
 And the more op@@ tions there are to consid@@ er, the more at@@ trac@@ tive fe@@ atu@@ res of these op@@ tions are going to be ref@@ lec@@ ted by us as opportunity co@@ st@@ s.    
 Here's another examp@@ le.    
 Now this car@@ to@@ on makes a lot of poin@@ ts.    
 It makes poin@@ ts about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things s@@ low@@ ly.    
 But one point it makes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you're choos@@ ing one thing, you're choos@@ ing not to do other things that may have lots of at@@ trac@@ tive fe@@ atu@@ re@@ s, and it's going to make what you're doing less at@@ trac@@ tive.    
 Th@@ ir@@ d@@ : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ ta@@ tions.    
 This hit me when I went to re@@ place my je@@ an@@ s.    
 I wear je@@ ans almost all the time.    
 There was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ v@@ or, and you b@@ ought them, and they fit like cra@@ p, they were incredi@@ b@@ ly un@@ comfor@@ table, if you wor@@ e them and was@@ h@@ ed them enough times, they started to feel O@@ K@@ .    
 I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans after years of we@@ aring these old on@@ es, and I said, "I want a pa@@ ir of je@@ an@@ s. Here's my si@@ z@@ e."    
 And the shop@@ keep@@ er said, "@@ Do you want sli@@ m f@@ it, easy f@@ it, rela@@ x@@ ed f@@ it?    
 You want bu@@ tt@@ on f@@ ly or z@@ i@@ pp@@ er fl@@ y? You want st@@ one@@ was@@ h@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ was@@ h@@ ed@@ ?    
 Do you want them dist@@ res@@ se@@ d?    
 You want boo@@ t cu@@ t, ta@@ per@@ ed, b@@ la@@ h b@@ la@@ h@@ ." On and on he w@@ ent.    
 My j@@ a@@ w dro@@ p@@ pe@@ d. And after I re@@ cover@@ ed, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kin@@ d@@ ."    
   He had no idea what that was, so I spent an hour trying on all these d@@ am@@ n je@@ an@@ s, and I walked out of the store -- tru@@ th@@ ! -- with the b@@ est@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting je@@ ans I had ever ha@@ d. I did better.    
 All this choice made it possible for me to do better. But -- I felt wor@@ se.    
 Wh@@ y? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to my@@ self.    
 The reason I felt worse is that, with all of these op@@ tions avail@@ able, my expec@@ ta@@ tions about how good a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans should be went up.    
 I had very low@@ , no particular expec@@ ta@@ tions when they only came in one fla@@ v@@ or.    
 When they came in 100 fla@@ vor@@ s, d@@ am@@ n it, one of them sh@@ oul@@ d@@ 've been perfec@@ t.    
 And what I got was goo@@ d, but it wasn't perfec@@ t.    
 And so I comp@@ ared what I got to what I expec@@ ted, and what I got was disap@@ poin@@ ting in com@@ par@@ is@@ on to what I expec@@ ted.    
 A@@ d@@ ding op@@ tions to people@@ 's lives can't help but increase the expec@@ ta@@ tions people have about how good those op@@ tions will be.    
 And what that's going to produce is less satis@@ fac@@ tion with resul@@ ts, even when they're good resul@@ ts.    
 No@@ body in the world of marke@@ ting knows this. [@@ It all looks so great@@ . I can't wa@@ it to be disap@@ poin@@ te@@ d@@ .@@ ] Because if they di@@ d, you wouldn't all know what this was ab@@ out.    
 The truth is more like this.    
 [@@ Every@@ thing was better back when everything was wor@@ se@@ ] The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was wor@@ se, it was actually possible for people to have experienc@@ es that were a ple@@ as@@ ant surpri@@ se.    
 No@@ wa@@ days, the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent, indu@@ stri@@ al@@ ized citi@@ zen@@ s, with perfec@@ tion the expec@@ ta@@ tion -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you ex@@ pect it to be. You will never be ple@@ as@@ an@@ tly surpri@@ sed because your expec@@ ta@@ tions, my expec@@ ta@@ tions, have gone through the ro@@ of.    
 The secre@@ t to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secre@@ t to happiness is low expec@@ ta@@ tions.    
   [@@ You@@ 'll do@@ ] just a little au@@ to@@ bio@@ graph@@ ical moment -- that I actually am married to a wi@@ f@@ e, and she's really quite wonder@@ ful.    
 I couldn't have done better. I didn't se@@ tt@@ le.    
 But se@@ tt@@ ling isn't always such a bad thing.    
 F@@ in@@ ally -- One consequ@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pa@@ ir of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fi@@ ed, and you ask wh@@ y, the answer is c@@ lear@@ : the world is respon@@ sib@@ le.    
 What could you do@@ ?    
 When there are hundreds of different st@@ y@@ les of je@@ ans avail@@ able, and you buy one that is disap@@ poin@@ ting, and you ask wh@@ y, who's respon@@ sib@@ le@@ ?    
 It is equ@@ ally cle@@ ar that the answer to the question is "@@ you@@ ."    
 You could have done better.    
 With a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on disp@@ la@@ y, there is no exc@@ use for fail@@ u@@ re.    
 And so when people make deci@@ sion@@ s, and even though the resul@@ ts of the decisions are goo@@ d, they feel disap@@ poin@@ ted about them@@ ; they bl@@ ame them@@ selves.    
 C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pres@@ sion has explo@@ ded in the indu@@ stri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation.    
 I believe a signific@@ ant -- not the on@@ ly, but a signific@@ ant -- con@@ tribu@@ tor to this explo@@ sion of de@@ pres@@ sion, and also suic@@ id@@ e, is that people have experienc@@ es that are disap@@ poin@@ ting because their stan@@ dar@@ ds are so high@@ , and then when they have to explain these experienc@@ es to them@@ selv@@ es, they think they're at fa@@ ul@@ t.    
 And so the net result is that we do better in gener@@ al, objec@@ tiv@@ ely, and we feel wor@@ se.    
 So let me re@@ mind you.    
 This is the offic@@ ial do@@ g@@ ma@@ , the one that we all take to be tru@@ e, and it's all f@@ al@@ se. It is not tru@@ e.    
 There's no question that some choice is better than n@@ one, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choic@@ e.    
 There's some ma@@ gi@@ cal amoun@@ t. I don't know what it is.    
 I'm pretty conf@@ id@@ ent that we have long since pas@@ sed the point where op@@ tions impro@@ ve our w@@ el@@ fa@@ re.    
 Now, as a polic@@ y matter -- I'm almost done -- as a polic@@ y mat@@ ter, the thing to think about is this: what en@@ ab@@ les all of this choice in indu@@ stri@@ al socie@@ ties is materi@@ al aff@@ lu@@ ence.    
 There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choic@@ e.    
 The@@ ir problem is that they have too litt@@ le.    
 So the stuff I'm talking about is the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar problem of moder@@ n, aff@@ lu@@ ent, W@@ es@@ ter@@ n socie@@ ties.    
 And what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this: Ste@@ ve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t talked to you y@@ es@@ ter@@ day about how these exp@@ en@@ sive and diffic@@ ul@@ t@@ -@@ to-@@ in@@ st@@ all child se@@ at@@ s don't hel@@ p. It's a wa@@ ste of mone@@ y.    
 What I'm telling you is that these exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve, complicated choices -- it's not simply that they don't hel@@ p.    
 They actually make us worse off.    
 If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our socie@@ ties to make all of the choices we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to socie@@ ties in which people have too few op@@ tions, not only would those people@@ 's lives be impro@@ v@@ ed, but our@@ s would be impro@@ ved al@@ so, which is what econom@@ ists call a "@@ P@@ are@@ to-@@ impro@@ ving mo@@ ve@@ ."    
 In@@ come re@@ di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion will make everyone better off -- not just po@@ or people -- because of how all this exc@@ ess choice pla@@ gu@@ es us.    
 So to con@@ cl@@ u@@ de. [@@ You can be anything you want to be -- no lim@@ it@@ s@@ ] You're supposed to read this car@@ to@@ on, and, being a s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated pers@@ on, say, "A@@ h@@ ! What does this fish know@@ ?    
 You know, nothing is possible in this fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ ."    
 I@@ m@@ po@@ ver@@ ish@@ ed imagin@@ ation, a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world -- and that's the way I read it at fir@@ st.    
 The more I thought about it, ho@@ we@@ ver, the more I came to the view that this fish knows some@@ thing.    
 Because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possib@@ le, you don't have fre@@ ed@@ om@@ . You have par@@ aly@@ si@@ s.    
 If you sh@@ at@@ ter this fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possib@@ le, you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion.    
 You increase par@@ aly@@ si@@ s, and you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion.    
 Every@@ body needs a fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ .    
 This one is almost certainly too lim@@ ited -- perhaps even for the fish@@ , certainly for us.    
 But the ab@@ s@@ ence of some me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or@@ ical fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ er@@ y, and, I s@@ us@@ pec@@ t, disa@@ st@@ er.    
 Thank you very much.    
 S@@ ever@@ al years ago here at TED@@ , Pe@@ ter S@@ kill@@ man intro@@ duc@@ ed a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challeng@@ e.    
 And the idea@@ 's pretty simp@@ le@@ : T@@ e@@ ams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est free@@ -@@ standing struc@@ ture out of 20 s@@ tic@@ ks of sp@@ a@@ gh@@ et@@ ti@@ , one y@@ ard of ta@@ p@@ e, one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ .    
 The mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top@@ .    
 And, though it seems really simp@@ le, it's actually pretty hard because it forc@@ es people to collabor@@ ate very quick@@ ly.    
 And so, I thought this was an interesting idea@@ , and I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop@@ .    
 And it was a huge succ@@ ess.    
 And since then, I've con@@ duc@@ ted about 7@@ 0 design work@@ shop@@ s across the world with students and desig@@ n@@ ers and architec@@ ts, even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne 5@@ 0, and there's something about this ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se about the nature of collabor@@ ation, and I'd like to share some of them with you.    
 So, nor@@ m@@ ally, most people begin by ori@@ ent@@ ing themselves to the t@@ as@@ k.    
 They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they j@@ oc@@ key for pow@@ er.    
 Then they spend some time plan@@ ning, organ@@ iz@@ ing, they s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch and they la@@ y out sp@@ a@@ gh@@ et@@ ti@@ .    
 They spend the maj@@ or@@ ity of their time as@@ se@@ mb@@ ling the s@@ tic@@ ks into ever@@ -@@ growing struc@@ ture@@ s.    
 And then finally, just as they're run@@ ning out of time, someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top@@ , and then they stand back, and -- ta@@ -@@ da@@ ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work.    
 But what really happen@@ s, most of the time, is that the "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " turns into an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ ," because the we@@ ight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low caus@@ es the entire struc@@ ture to b@@ uck@@ le and to col@@ la@@ p@@ se.    
 So there are a number of people who have a lot more "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ " moments than other@@ s, and am@@ ong the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school.    
   They li@@ e, they che@@ at, they get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted and they produce really l@@ ame struc@@ ture@@ s.    
 And of course there are te@@ ams that have a lot more "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " struc@@ tures, and am@@ ong the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ t@@ en.    
   And it's pretty ama@@ z@@ ing.    
 As Pe@@ ter tel@@ ls us, not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tures, but they're the most interesting struc@@ tures of them all.    
 So the question you want to ask is@@ : How com@@ e? Wh@@ y? What is it about them@@ ?    
 And Pe@@ ter li@@ kes to say that n@@ one of the kids spend any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of S@@ pa@@ gh@@ et@@ ti@@ , In@@ c@@ . Ri@@ ght?    
 They don't spend time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for pow@@ er.    
 But there's another reason as well.    
 And the reason is that business students are tra@@ ined to find the single right plan@@ , right?    
 And then they ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te on it.    
 And then what happens is, when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top@@ , they run out of time and what happen@@ s?    
 It's a cri@@ si@@ s.    
 S@@ ound famili@@ ar@@ ? Ri@@ ght.    
 What kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ ently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ , and they build pro@@ to@@ typ@@ es, succ@@ es@@ sive pro@@ to@@ typ@@ es, always keep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top@@ , so they have multi@@ ple times to fi@@ x when they build pro@@ to@@ types along the way.    
 D@@ es@@ ig@@ n@@ ers recog@@ n@@ ize this type of collabor@@ ation as the ess@@ ence of the it@@ er@@ ative proc@@ ess.    
 And with each ver@@ sion, kids get in@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what wor@@ ks and what doesn't work.    
 So the cap@@ ac@@ ity to play in pro@@ to@@ type is really ess@@ enti@@ al, but let's look at how different te@@ ams perfor@@ m.    
 So the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ch@@ es@@ ; business school@@ s stud@@ ents, about half of that@@ ; law@@ y@@ ers, a little bet@@ ter, but not much better than that, kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers, better than most adul@@ ts.    
 Who does the very b@@ est@@ ?    
 Ar@@ ch@@ itec@@ ts and engine@@ ers, th@@ an@@ k@@ ful@@ ly.    
   Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ nine in@@ ch@@ es is the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ ture I've se@@ en.    
 And why is it? Because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and self-@@ re@@ infor@@ c@@ ing ge@@ ome@@ tri@@ cal patter@@ ns are the key to building st@@ able struc@@ ture@@ s.    
 So C@@ E@@ O@@ s, a little bit better than aver@@ age, but here's where it gets interes@@ t@@ ing.    
 If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the te@@ am, they get signific@@ an@@ tly better.    
   It's incredi@@ b@@ le. You know, you look aroun@@ d, you go@@ , "O@@ h, that te@@ am@@ 's going to win@@ ."    
 You can just tell before@@ han@@ d. And why is that?    
 Because they have speci@@ al sk@@ ill@@ s of fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation.    
 They man@@ age the proc@@ ess, they understand the proc@@ ess.    
 And any team who man@@ ages and pa@@ ys close att@@ ention to work will signific@@ an@@ tly impro@@ ve the te@@ am@@ 's perfor@@ man@@ ce.    
 S@@ peci@@ al@@ ized sk@@ ill@@ s and fac@@ il@@ it@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s are the comb@@ in@@ ation that lead@@ s to strong succ@@ ess.    
 If you have 10 te@@ ams that ty@@ pic@@ ally perfor@@ m, you'll get maybe six or so that have standing struc@@ ture@@ s.    
 And I tried something interes@@ t@@ ing.    
 I thought, let's up the ant@@ e, on@@ ce.    
 So I offer@@ ed a 10@@ ,000 dol@@ lar pri@@ ze of so@@ f@@ tw@@ are to the win@@ ning te@@ am.    
 So what do you think happened to these design stud@@ ent@@ s?    
 What was the resul@@ t?    
 Here's what happen@@ ed@@ : Not one team had a standing struc@@ ture.    
 If anyone had buil@@ t, say, a one in@@ ch struc@@ ture, they would have taken home the pri@@ z@@ e.    
 So, isn't that interes@@ t@@ ing? That high sta@@ kes have a strong imp@@ ac@@ t.    
 We did the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se again with the same stud@@ ents.    
 What do you think happened th@@ en@@ ?    
 So now they understand the value of pro@@ to@@ typ@@ ing.    
 So the same team went from being the very worst to being am@@ ong the very b@@ es@@ t.    
 They produc@@ ed the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tures in the least amount of time.    
 about the nature of inc@@ enti@@ ves and succ@@ ess.    
 So, you might as@@ k@@ : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challen@@ ge@@ ?    
 And the reason is, I help create digital tools and process@@ es to help te@@ ams build car@@ s and video games and vi@@ su@@ al effec@@ ts.    
 And what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it hel@@ ps them identi@@ fy the h@@ idd@@ en as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions.    
 Be@@ cause, f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly, every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ , doesn't it?    
 The challenge provid@@ es a sha@@ red experienc@@ e, a comm@@ on langu@@ age, a comm@@ on stan@@ ce to build the right pro@@ to@@ typ@@ e.    
 of this so simple ex@@ er@@ ci@@ se.    
 And those of you who are interested may want to go to M@@ ar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .@@ com@@ .    
 It's a b@@ lo@@ g that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ s.    
 There's st@@ ep@@ -@@ by@@ -@@ step in@@ struc@@ tions on this.    
 There are crazy exam@@ ples from around the world of how people t@@ wea@@ k and ad@@ just the system.    
 There's world rec@@ or@@ ds that are on this as well.    
 And the fundamental less@@ on, I believ@@ e, is that design truly is a cont@@ act sp@@ or@@ t.    
 It de@@ man@@ ds that we bring all of our sen@@ ses to the t@@ as@@ k, and that we app@@ ly the very best of our thinking, our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at han@@ d.    
 And some@@ times, a little pro@@ to@@ type of this experience from an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ " moment to a "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " mom@@ ent.    
 And that can make a big differ@@ ence.    
 Thank you very much.    
 Let's pret@@ end right here we have a mach@@ ine.    
 A big mach@@ ine, a co@@ ol@@ , TED@@ -@@ ish mach@@ ine, and it's a time mach@@ ine.    
 And everyone in this room has to get into it.    
 And you can go back@@ war@@ ds, you can go for@@ war@@ ds@@ ; you cannot sta@@ y where you are.    
 And I won@@ der what you'd choos@@ e, because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lat@@ ely and they all want to go back.    
 I don't know. They want to go back before there were au@@ tom@@ ob@@ il@@ es or T@@ wit@@ ter or "@@ American I@@ dol@@ ."    
 I don't know.    
 I'm con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that there's some sort of pul@@ l to no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a, to wi@@ sh@@ ful thin@@ king.    
 And I understand that.    
 I'm not part of that c@@ row@@ d, I have to sa@@ y.    
 I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rou@@ s.    
 It's because possibili@@ ties on this plane@@ t, So I want to get in the mach@@ ine, and I want to go for@@ war@@ d.    
 This is the greatest time there's ever been on this plan@@ et by any measure that you w@@ ish to ch@@ oo@@ se@@ : heal@@ th, we@@ al@@ th, mo@@ b@@ il@@ ity, opportun@@ ity, de@@ cl@@ ining r@@ ates of dise@@ ase ...    
 There's never been a time like this.    
 My great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents di@@ ed, all of them, by the time they were 6@@ 0@@ .    
 My grand@@ parents push@@ ed that number to 7@@ 0@@ .    
 My parents are clo@@ sing in on 80@@ .    
 a nine at the beginning of my death numb@@ er.    
 But it's not even about people like us, because this is a bigg@@ er deal than that.    
 A kid born in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i today can ex@@ pect to live as long as the ri@@ ch@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago.    
 Th@@ ink about that, it's an incredi@@ ble fac@@ t.    
 And why is it tru@@ e?    
 S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x@@ . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x killed billi@@ ons of people on this planet.    
 It res@@ ha@@ ped the demo@@ graph@@ y of the glo@@ be in a way that no wa@@ r ever ha@@ s.    
 It's g@@ one. It's v@@ ani@@ sh@@ ed.    
 We v@@ an@@ qui@@ sh@@ ed it. P@@ u@@ ff@@ .    
 In the rich world, diseas@@ es that thre@@ at@@ ened milli@@ ons of us just a generation ago no longer exist@@ , har@@ d@@ ly.    
 Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ i@@ a, ru@@ bel@@ la@@ , poli@@ o ...    
 does anyone even know what those things are@@ ?    
 V@@ acc@@ in@@ es, moder@@ n medic@@ ine, our ability to feed billi@@ ons of people, those are tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s of the scientific me@@ tho@@ d.    
 And to my min@@ d, the scientific me@@ th@@ od -- trying stuff out, seeing if it work@@ s, changing it when it doesn't -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments of human@@ ity.    
 So that's the good new@@ s.    
 Un@@ fortun@@ ately, that's all the good news because there are some other problem@@ s, and they@@ 've been men@@ tion@@ ed many times.    
 And one of them is that des@@ p@@ ite all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment@@ s, a billion people go to bed hun@@ gr@@ y in this world every day.    
 That numb@@ er@@ 's ris@@ ing, and it's ri@@ sing really ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly, and it's dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful.    
 And not only that, we've used our imagin@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tr@@ as@@ h this glo@@ be.    
 P@@ o@@ table wat@@ er, ar@@ able lan@@ d, ra@@ in@@ fore@@ sts, o@@ il, g@@ as@@ : they're going away, and they're going away so@@ on, and un@@ less we inno@@ v@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess, we're going away too@@ .    
 So the question is@@ : Can we do that? And I think we can@@ .    
 that will feed billi@@ ons of people without ra@@ ping the land that they live on.    
 I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also des@@ tro@@ y it.    
 I really do believe that, and, no@@ , it ain@@ 't wi@@ sh@@ ful thin@@ king.    
 But here's the thing that keep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght -- one of the things that keep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght@@ : We've never needed progres@@ s in science more than we need it right now. N@@ ever@@ .    
 to dep@@ lo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today.    
 in many fiel@@ ds, and yet I actually think we@@ 'd have to go back hundre@@ ds, 3@@ 00 years, before the En@@ light@@ en@@ ment, to find a time when we b@@ att@@ led progres@@ s, when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous@@ ly, on more f@@ ron@@ ts, than we do now.    
 People w@@ ra@@ p themselves in their beli@@ e@@ f@@ s, and they do it so ti@@ ght@@ ly that you can't set them fre@@ e.    
 Not even the truth will set them fre@@ e.    
 And, list@@ en, every@@ one's enti@@ t@@ led to their opini@@ on@@ ; they're even enti@@ t@@ led to their opini@@ on about progres@@ s.    
 But you know what you're not enti@@ t@@ led to@@ ?    
 You're not enti@@ t@@ led to your own fac@@ ts. S@@ or@@ r@@ y, you're no@@ t.    
 And this took me a@@ while to figure out.    
 A@@ b@@ out a deca@@ de ago, I wrote a story about vacc@@ ines for The New Yor@@ k@@ er. A little story.    
 And I was ama@@ zed to find op@@ posi@@ tion@@ : op@@ posi@@ tion to what is, after all, the most effec@@ tive public health measure in human hi@@ story.    
 I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do@@ : I wrote a story and I moved on.    
 And soon after that, I wrote a story about gene@@ tically engine@@ ered foo@@ d.    
 S@@ ame thing, only bigg@@ er.    
 People were going craz@@ y.    
 So I wrote a story about that to@@ o, and I couldn't understand why people thought this was "@@ Fran@@ k@@ en@@ foo@@ ds@@ ," why they thought moving mo@@ le@@ cul@@ es around in a speci@@ fic@@ , rather than a ha@@ p@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way, was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ sing on natu@@ re@@ 's grou@@ n@@ d.    
 But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.    
 I mean, I'm a jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ .    
 We typ@@ e, we fi@@ le, we go to d@@ in@@ n@@ er. It's fin@@ e.    
   But these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me, and I couldn't figure out wh@@ y, and even@@ tu@@ ally I di@@ d.    
 And that's because those f@@ an@@ a@@ tics that were dri@@ ving me crazy weren't actually f@@ an@@ a@@ tics at all.    
 They were thou@@ ght@@ ful people, educ@@ ated people, dec@@ ent people.    
 They were exactly like the people in this room.    
 And it just dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much.    
 But then I thought, you know, let's be hon@@ es@@ t.    
 We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progres@@ s that we used to.    
 We talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ent@@ ly.    
 We talk about it in ir@@ on@@ ic terms with little qu@@ o@@ tes around it@@ : "@@ progres@@ s."    
 Oka@@ y, there are reas@@ ons for that, and I think we know what those reas@@ ons are.    
 We've lo@@ st fa@@ ith in in@@ stitu@@ tions, in au@@ th@@ or@@ ity, and sometimes in science it@@ self, and there's no reason we sh@@ ouldn't ha@@ ve.    
 You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will under@@ stan@@ d.    
 C@@ her@@ no@@ by@@ l@@ , B@@ hop@@ al, the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er, V@@ i@@ o@@ x@@ x, we@@ ap@@ ons of ma@@ ss des@@ truc@@ tion, han@@ g@@ ing cha@@ ds.    
 You know, you can choose your li@@ st.    
 There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right, so be sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ al.    
 A@@ s@@ k ques@@ tions, de@@ m@@ and pro@@ of, de@@ m@@ and ev@@ id@@ ence.    
 D@@ on@@ 't take anything for gran@@ ted.    
 But here's the thing@@ : When you get pro@@ of, you need to acc@@ ept the pro@@ of, and we're not that good at doing that.    
 And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an ep@@ id@@ em@@ ic of fe@@ ar like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.    
 A@@ b@@ out 1@@ 2 years ago, there was a story publi@@ sh@@ ed, to the meas@@ l@@ es, mu@@ mp@@ s and ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a vacc@@ ine sho@@ t.    
 V@@ ery sc@@ ary.    
 T@@ ons of stu@@ dies were done to see if this was tru@@ e.    
 T@@ ons of stu@@ dies should have been don@@ e@@ ; it's a seri@@ ous issu@@ e.    
 The data came back.    
 The data came back from the United St@@ ates, from Eng@@ lan@@ d, from S@@ we@@ d@@ en, from C@@ an@@ ada@@ , and it was all the sam@@ e: no cor@@ rela@@ tion, no connec@@ tion, n@@ one at all.    
 It doesn't mat@@ ter. It doesn't matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ do@@ t@@ es, we believe what we see, what we think we see, what makes us feel real@@ .    
 We don't believe a bunch of do@@ cu@@ ments from a government offic@@ ial giving us dat@@ a, and I do understand that, I think we all do.    
 But you know what@@ ?    
 The result of that has been disa@@ st@@ rou@@ s.    
 Di@@ sa@@ st@@ rou@@ s because here's a fac@@ t@@ : The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vacc@@ ine r@@ ate for meas@@ les is going dow@@ n.    
 That is dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful, and we should be as@@ ha@@ med of our@@ selves.    
 It's hor@@ ri@@ b@@ le.    
 What kind of a thing happened that we could do that?    
 Now, I understand it. I do understand it.    
 Be@@ cause, did anyone have meas@@ les her@@ e?    
 H@@ as one person in this audi@@ ence ever seen someone di@@ e of meas@@ l@@ es?    
 Do@@ es@@ n't happen very much.    
 Do@@ es@@ n't happen in this country at all, but it happened 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ ,000 times in the world last year.    
 That's a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour@@ .    
 But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our min@@ ds, and people like J@@ en@@ ny M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ th@@ y can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing messa@@ g@@ es of fe@@ ar and il@@ liter@@ ac@@ y from pl@@ at@@ forms like "O@@ p@@ ra@@ h@@ " and "@@ L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing Li@@ ve@@ ."    
 And they can do it because they don't lin@@ k caus@@ ation and cor@@ rela@@ tion.    
 They don't understand that these things seem the sam@@ e, but they're almost never the sam@@ e.    
 And it's something we need to lear@@ n, and we need to learn it really so@@ on.    
 This guy was a her@@ o, J@@ on@@ as S@@ al@@ k.    
 He took one of the worst s@@ cour@@ g@@ es of man@@ kind away from us.    
 No fear@@ , no ag@@ on@@ y. P@@ o@@ li@@ o -- pu@@ ff@@ , g@@ one.    
 That guy in the m@@ idd@@ le, not so much.    
 H@@ is name is P@@ au@@ l O@@ ff@@ it.    
 He just develop@@ ed a ro@@ ta@@ vir@@ us vacc@@ ine with a bunch of other people.    
 in the develop@@ ing world every year.    
 P@@ re@@ t@@ ty goo@@ d, right?    
 Well, it's goo@@ d, excep@@ t that P@@ au@@ l goes around talking about vacc@@ ines and says how valu@@ able they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing.    
 And he actually says it that way.    
 So, P@@ a@@ ul@@ 's a ter@@ ror@@ ist@@ .    
 When P@@ au@@ l spea@@ ks in a public hear@@ ing, he can't tes@@ ti@@ fy without ar@@ med gu@@ ar@@ ds.    
 He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school.    
 And wh@@ y? Because P@@ au@@ l made a vacc@@ ine.    
 I don't need to say this, but vacc@@ ines are ess@@ enti@@ al.    
 You take them away, dise@@ ase comes back, hor@@ ri@@ ble diseas@@ es. And that's happen@@ ing.    
 We have meas@@ les in this country now.    
 And it's getting wor@@ se, and pretty soon kids are going to di@@ e of it again because it's just a numb@@ ers game.    
 And they're not just going to di@@ e of meas@@ les.    
 What about poli@@ o@@ ? Let's have that. Why no@@ t?    
 A colle@@ ge clas@@ sm@@ ate of m@@ ine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little stri@@ d@@ ent.    
 No one's ever said that before.    
 She wasn't going to vacc@@ in@@ ate her kid against poli@@ o, no way.    
 F@@ ine.    
 Wh@@ y? Because we don't have poli@@ o. And you know what@@ ?    
 We didn't have poli@@ o in this country y@@ es@@ ter@@ day.    
 To@@ day, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plan@@ e in L@@ ago@@ s this morning, and he's fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X@@ , right now he's over O@@ hi@@ o.    
 And he's going to land in a couple of hour@@ s, he's going to ren@@ t a car@@ , and he's going to come to L@@ ong Be@@ ach@@ , and he's going to att@@ end one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous TED d@@ in@@ n@@ ers ton@@ i@@ ght.    
 And he doesn't know that he's in@@ fec@@ ted with a par@@ aly@@ tic diseas@@ e, and we don't ei@@ ther because that's the way the world work@@ s.    
 That's the plan@@ et we live on. D@@ on@@ 't pret@@ end it is@@ n'@@ t.    
 Now, we love to w@@ ra@@ p ourselves in li@@ es. We love to do it.    
 Every@@ one take their v@@ it@@ am@@ ins this mor@@ n@@ ing?    
 E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ ea@@ , a little an@@ ti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ ant to get you go@@ ing.    
 I know you did because half of Americ@@ ans do every day.    
 They take the stuff@@ , and they take alter@@ na@@ tive medic@@ in@@ es, and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're us@@ el@@ ess.    
 The data says it all the time.    
 They dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine. They almost never do more than that.    
   It's oka@@ y, you want to pa@@ y 2@@ 8 billion dollars for dar@@ k ur@@ ine@@ ?    
 I'm totally with you.    
   D@@ ar@@ k ur@@ ine. D@@ ar@@ k.    
 Why do we do that? Why do we do that?    
 Well, I think I under@@ stan@@ d, we h@@ ate B@@ i@@ g P@@ har@@ ma@@ .    
 We h@@ ate B@@ i@@ g Go@@ vern@@ ment. We don't trust the M@@ an.    
 And we sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n'@@ t@@ : Our health care system su@@ c@@ ks.    
 It's cru@@ el to milli@@ ons of people.    
 It's absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly co@@ ld and sou@@ l@@ -@@ b@@ ending to those of us who can even aff@@ ord it.    
 So we run away from it, and where do we run@@ ?    
 We lea@@ p into the ar@@ ms of B@@ i@@ g P@@ l@@ ace@@ bo@@ .    
   That's f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic. I love B@@ i@@ g P@@ l@@ ace@@ bo@@ .    
   But, you know, it's really a seri@@ ous thing because this stuff is cra@@ p, and we spend billi@@ ons of dollars on it.    
 And I have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here.    
 N@@ one of it ... g@@ in@@ k@@ go@@ , fra@@ u@@ d@@ ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ ea@@ , fra@@ u@@ d@@ ; a@@ ca@@ i -- I don't even know what that is but we're sp@@ ending billi@@ ons of dollars on it -- it's fra@@ u@@ d.    
 And you know what@@ ? When I say this stuff@@ , people scre@@ am at me, and they say, "What do you care@@ ? L@@ et people do what they want to do.    
 It makes them feel goo@@ d@@ ."    
 And you know what@@ ? You're wr@@ ong@@ .    
 if it's the secre@@ t@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who's say@@ ing, "H@@ m@@ m, I'm not going to take the evidence of my exper@@ ts on ma@@ m@@ mo@@ gr@@ am@@ s@@ ," or some can@@ c@@ er qu@@ ack who wan@@ ts to tre@@ at his pati@@ ent with co@@ ff@@ e@@ e ene@@ ma@@ s.    
 When you start down the road where beli@@ ef and magic re@@ place evidence and sci@@ ence, you end up in a place you don't want to be.    
 You end up in T@@ ha@@ b@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i South Afri@@ ca@@ .    
 He killed 4@@ 00@@ ,000 of his people by in@@ sist@@ ing that be@@ et@@ roo@@ t, gar@@ li@@ c and le@@ m@@ on o@@ il were much more effec@@ tive than the an@@ ti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral d@@ ru@@ g@@ s we know can s@@ low the course of A@@ I@@ D@@ S.    
 H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of thousands of need@@ less dea@@ th@@ s in a country that has been pla@@ gu@@ ed worse than any other by this diseas@@ e.    
 P@@ le@@ as@@ e, don't tell me there are no consequ@@ ences to these things.    
 There are. There always are.    
 Now, the most mind@@ less ep@@ id@@ em@@ ic is this ab@@ sur@@ d bat@@ tle between pro@@ p@@ on@@ ents of gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food and the organ@@ ic el@@ it@@ e.    
 It's an i@@ di@@ o@@ tic de@@ bat@@ e. It has to stop@@ .    
 It's a de@@ b@@ ate about words, about me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or@@ s.    
 It's ide@@ o@@ log@@ y, it's not sci@@ ence.    
 Every single thing we e@@ at, every gra@@ in of ri@@ ce, every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ sle@@ y, every Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s sp@@ r@@ out has been mo@@ di@@ fied by man@@ .    
 You know, there weren't t@@ ang@@ er@@ ines in the gar@@ d@@ en of E@@ d@@ en.    
 There wasn't any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e. There weren't Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as tre@@ es. We made it all.    
 We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 years.    
 And some of it wor@@ ke@@ d, and some of it di@@ d@@ n'@@ t.    
 We got ri@@ d of the stuff that di@@ d@@ n'@@ t.    
 Now we can do it in a more pre@@ ci@@ se way -- and there are risk@@ s, absolutely -- but we can put something like v@@ it@@ am@@ in A into ri@@ ce, and that stuff can help milli@@ ons of people, milli@@ ons of people, pro@@ long their lives.    
 You don't want to do that?    
 I have to say, I don't understand it.    
 We objec@@ t to gene@@ tically engine@@ ered foo@@ d.    
 Why do we do that?    
 Well, the things I con@@ stan@@ tly hear are@@ : To@@ o many chemic@@ als, p@@ es@@ tic@@ id@@ es, hor@@ mon@@ es, mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ture, we don't want gi@@ ant fiel@@ ds of the same thing, that's wr@@ ong@@ .    
 We don't companies pat@@ ent@@ ing life.    
 We don't want companies ow@@ ning se@@ ed@@ s.    
 And you know what my respon@@ se to all of that is@@ ?    
 Y@@ es, you're right. Let's fi@@ x it.    
 It's tru@@ e, we've got a huge food proble@@ m, but this isn't sci@@ ence.    
 This has nothing to do with sci@@ ence.    
 It's law@@ , it's mor@@ al@@ ity, it's pat@@ ent stuff@@ .    
 You know science isn't a compan@@ y.    
 It's not a countr@@ y.    
 It's not even an idea@@ ; it's a proc@@ ess.    
 It's a proc@@ ess, and sometimes it wor@@ ks and sometimes it does@@ n'@@ t, but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afra@@ id@@ , is really very de@@ ad@@ en@@ ing, and it's pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing milli@@ ons of people from pro@@ s@@ per@@ ing.    
 You know, in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 7@@ 0 percent more food than we do right now, 7@@ 0 perc@@ ent.    
 This inv@@ est@@ ment in Afri@@ c@@ a over the last 30 years.    
 D@@ is@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful. D@@ is@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful.    
 They need it, and we're not giving it to them.    
 And wh@@ y? G@@ ene@@ tically engine@@ ered foo@@ d.    
 We don't want to en@@ courage people to e@@ at that ro@@ tten stuff@@ , like cas@@ sa@@ v@@ a for instan@@ ce.    
 C@@ as@@ sa@@ va@@ 's something that half a billion people e@@ at.    
 It's kind of like a pot@@ at@@ o.    
 It's just a bunch of cal@@ ori@@ es. It su@@ c@@ ks.    
 It doesn't have nu@@ tri@@ ents, it doesn't have prote@@ in, and scientists are engine@@ ering all of that into it right now.    
 And then people would be able to e@@ at it and they@@ 'd be able to not go bl@@ in@@ d.    
 They wouldn't star@@ ve, and you know what@@ ?    
 That would be n@@ ic@@ e. It wouldn't be C@@ he@@ z P@@ an@@ is@@ se, but it would be n@@ ic@@ e.    
 And all I can say about this is@@ : Why are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it?    
 I mean, let's ask our@@ selv@@ es@@ : Why are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it?    
 Because we don't want to move gen@@ es aroun@@ d?    
 This is about moving gen@@ es aroun@@ d. It's not about chemic@@ als.    
 It's not about our ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es, our in@@ sist@@ ence on having bigg@@ er food, better food, sing@@ ular foo@@ d.    
 This isn't about R@@ ice K@@ ri@@ spi@@ es, this is about keep@@ ing people ali@@ ve, and it's about time we started to understand what that mean@@ t.    
 Be@@ cause, you know some@@ thing@@ ?    
 If we don@@ '@@ t, if we contin@@ ue to act the way we're ac@@ ting, we're gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don't think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of@@ : high@@ -@@ te@@ ch col@@ on@@ i@@ al@@ ism.    
 There's no other way to descri@@ be what's going on here.    
 It's sel@@ fish@@ , it's u@@ g@@ ly, it's bene@@ ath us, and we really have to stop it.    
 So after this ama@@ z@@ ingly fu@@ n conversa@@ tion, you might want to say, "@@ So, you still want to get in this ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go for@@ war@@ d@@ ?"    
 A@@ b@@ solu@@ tel@@ y. A@@ b@@ solu@@ tel@@ y, I do.    
 It's st@@ uc@@ k in the present right now, but we have an amazing opportun@@ ity.    
 We can set that time machine on anything we wan@@ t.    
 We can move it where we want to move it, and we're going to move it where we want to move it.    
 We have to have these conversa@@ tions and we have to think, but when we get in the time machine and we go a@@ hea@@ d, we're going to be happy we do.    
 I know that we can@@ , and as far as I'm con@@ cer@@ ne@@ d, that's something the world needs right now.    
   Thank you.    
 One day, L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es T@@ im@@ es col@@ um@@ n@@ ist Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z was walking along the stree@@ ts of down@@ town L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es when he heard beautiful mus@@ ic.    
 And the sour@@ ce was a man, an Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American man, char@@ m@@ ing, ru@@ g@@ ge@@ d, hom@@ el@@ ess, playing a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings.    
 And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Ste@@ v@@ e's col@@ um@@ ns became the bas@@ is for a book, which was turned into a movi@@ e, with R@@ ob@@ er@@ t D@@ ow@@ ney J@@ r. ac@@ ting as Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z@@ , and J@@ am@@ i@@ e F@@ o@@ x@@ x as Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el An@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ y@@ ers, the J@@ u@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ ined d@@ ou@@ ble bas@@ si@@ st wh@@ ose prom@@ is@@ ing care@@ er was c@@ ut short by a tra@@ gic aff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ re@@ ni@@ a.    
 Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el dro@@ pped out of J@@ u@@ illi@@ ar@@ d, he suffer@@ ed a comple@@ te brea@@ k@@ dow@@ n, and 30 years later he was living hom@@ el@@ ess on the stree@@ ts of S@@ kid R@@ ow in down@@ town L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es.    
 I en@@ courage all of you to read Ste@@ v@@ e's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond that for@@ med between these two m@@ en, but how music helped shape that bon@@ d, and ultim@@ ately was in@@ stru@@ mental -- if you'll par@@ d@@ on the pu@@ n -- in hel@@ ping Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el get off the stre@@ et@@ s.    
 I met M@@ r. A@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 8@@ , two years ago, at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all.    
 He had just heard a perfor@@ man@@ ce of Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven@@ 's Fir@@ st and F@@ our@@ th sy@@ mp@@ hon@@ ies, and came back@@ st@@ age and intro@@ duc@@ ed hi@@ m@@ self.    
 He was spea@@ king in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about Y@@ o@@ -@@ Y@@ o M@@ a and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ t@@ on and how the Do@@ dg@@ ers were never going to make the World S@@ eri@@ es, all because of the tre@@ ac@@ her@@ ous first viol@@ in pas@@ sa@@ ge work in the last mov@@ ement of Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven@@ 's F@@ our@@ th S@@ y@@ mp@@ hon@@ y.    
 And we got talking about mus@@ ic, and I got an e@@ ma@@ il from Ste@@ ve a few days later sa@@ ying that Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el was interested in a viol@@ in less@@ on with me.    
 Now, I should men@@ tion that Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el ref@@ us@@ es tre@@ at@@ ment because when he was tre@@ ated it was with sh@@ oc@@ k ther@@ ap@@ y and Th@@ or@@ az@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s, and that s@@ car has sta@@ yed with him for his entire life.    
 But as a result now, he is p@@ r@@ one to these sch@@ iz@@ op@@ h@@ re@@ ni@@ c ep@@ is@@ o@@ d@@ es, the worst of which can man@@ i@@ f@@ est themselves as him explo@@ ding and then disap@@ pe@@ aring for days, wan@@ der@@ ing the stree@@ ts of S@@ kid R@@ ow, ex@@ pos@@ ed to its hor@@ ror@@ s, with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed up@@ on him.    
 And Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el was in such a state of ag@@ it@@ ation when we started our first less@@ on at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all -- he had a kind of man@@ ic g@@ lin@@ t in his ey@@ es, he was lo@@ st.    
 And he was talking about in@@ vi@@ sible de@@ mon@@ s and s@@ mo@@ ke, and how someone was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing him in his sle@@ ep@@ .    
 And I was afra@@ id@@ , not for my@@ self, but I was afraid that I was going to lo@@ se him, that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his st@@ ates, and that I would ru@@ in his relationship with the viol@@ in if I started talking about scal@@ es and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exc@@ iting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic viol@@ in pe@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ y.    
   So, I just started play@@ ing.    
 And I play@@ ed the first mov@@ ement of the Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven V@@ i@@ ol@@ in Con@@ cer@@ to.    
 And as I play@@ ed, I underst@@ ood that there was a pro@@ found change oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing in Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el@@ 's ey@@ es.    
 It was as if he was in the g@@ ri@@ p of some in@@ vi@@ sible ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tic@@ al, a chemical reac@@ tion, for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st.    
 And Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el@@ 's man@@ ic ra@@ ge was trans@@ for@@ med into under@@ stand@@ ing, a qui@@ et curi@@ os@@ ity and gr@@ ac@@ e.    
 And in a mirac@@ le, he lif@@ ted his own viol@@ in and he started play@@ ing, by ear@@ , certain s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of viol@@ in con@@ cer@@ to@@ s which he then asked me to comple@@ te -- M@@ end@@ el@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n, T@@ cha@@ i@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ sk@@ y, Si@@ beli@@ us.    
 And we started talking about mus@@ ic, from B@@ ach to Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven and B@@ ra@@ h@@ ms, Br@@ uck@@ n@@ er, all the B@@ '@@ s, from B@@ ar@@ t@@ ó@@ k, all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ Pe@@ k@@ k@@ a S@@ al@@ on@@ en.    
 And I underst@@ ood that he not only had an enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of mus@@ ic, but he rel@@ ated to this music at a person@@ al level@@ .    
 He spo@@ ke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleag@@ u@@ es in the L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es P@@ h@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic.    
 And through playing music and talking about mus@@ ic, this man had trans@@ for@@ med from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id@@ , dist@@ ur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the stree@@ ts of down@@ town L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es to the char@@ m@@ ing, er@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ e, br@@ illi@@ ant, J@@ u@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ ined mus@@ ici@@ an.    
 M@@ us@@ ic is medic@@ ine. M@@ us@@ ic changes us.    
 And for Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el, music is s@@ an@@ ity.    
 Because music allow@@ s him to take his thou@@ ghts and del@@ usi@@ ons and shape them through his imagin@@ ation and his creativ@@ ity, into real@@ ity.    
 And that is an es@@ cap@@ e from his tor@@ mented st@@ ate.    
 And I underst@@ ood that this was the very ess@@ ence of ar@@ t.    
 This was the very reason why we made mus@@ ic, that we take something that exist@@ s within all of us at our very fundamental co@@ re, our emo@@ tions, and through our arti@@ sti@@ c l@@ en@@ s, through our creativ@@ ity, we're able to shape those emo@@ tions into real@@ ity.    
 And the reality of that ex@@ pres@@ sion reach@@ es all of us and mo@@ ves us, inspi@@ res and un@@ it@@ es us.    
 And for Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el, music brought him back into a f@@ old of friend@@ s.    
 The re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of mus@@ ici@@ ans that underst@@ ood him, that recog@@ n@@ ized his tal@@ ents and res@@ pec@@ ted him.    
 And I will always make music with Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el, whether we're at W@@ al@@ t D@@ is@@ ney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all or on S@@ kid R@@ ow, because he re@@ min@@ ds me why I became a mus@@ ici@@ an.    
 Thank you.    
   B@@ run@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ ani@@ : Thank you. Th@@ an@@ ks.    
 R@@ ob@@ er@@ t G@@ up@@ ta@@ .    
   R@@ ob@@ er@@ t G@@ up@@ ta@@ : I'm going to play something that I sha@@ m@@ el@@ ess@@ ly st@@ o@@ le from c@@ el@@ list@@ s.    
 So, please for@@ give me.    
 I'm J@@ an@@ e M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al. I'm a game desig@@ n@@ er.    
 I've been making games online now for 10 years, and my goal for the next deca@@ de is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online gam@@ es.    
 Now, I have a pl@@ an for this, and it ent@@ a@@ ils con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing more people, including all of you, to spend more time playing bigg@@ er and better gam@@ es.    
 Ri@@ ght now we spend three billion hours a week playing online gam@@ es.    
 Some of you might be thinking, "@@ That's a lot of time to spend playing gam@@ es.    
 Maybe too much time, consid@@ ering how many ur@@ g@@ ent problems we have to solve in the real world@@ ."    
 But actu@@ ally, acc@@ or@@ ding to my research at the In@@ stitu@@ te for the F@@ u@@ ture, actually the op@@ pos@@ ite is tru@@ e.    
 Th@@ ree billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play In fact, I believe that if we want to survi@@ ve the next centur@@ y on this plane@@ t, we need to increase that to@@ tal drama@@ tic@@ ally.    
 I've cal@@ cul@@ ated the to@@ tal we need at 2@@ 1 billion hours of game play every wee@@ k.    
 So, that's probably a bit of a coun@@ ter@@ -@@ intui@@ tive idea@@ , so I'll say it again, let it sin@@ k in@@ : If we want to solve problems like hun@@ g@@ er, po@@ ver@@ ty, climate chang@@ e, global conf@@ lic@@ t, ob@@ es@@ ity, I believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play games online for at least 2@@ 1 billion hours a wee@@ k, by the end of the next deca@@ de.    
   No@@ . I'm seri@@ ous. I am.    
 Here's wh@@ y.    
 This picture pretty much su@@ ms up why I think games are so ess@@ ential T@@ rul@@ y. This is a por@@ tra@@ it by photograph@@ er P@@ hi@@ l To@@ le@@ d@@ an@@ o.    
 He wanted to cap@@ ture the emo@@ tion of gam@@ ing, so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were play@@ ing.    
 And this is a clas@@ si@@ c gam@@ ing emo@@ tion.    
 Now, if you're not a gam@@ er, you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this photo@@ .    
 You probably see the sense of ur@@ g@@ enc@@ y, a little bit of fear@@ , but in@@ ten@@ se con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion, deep@@ , de@@ ep foc@@ us on t@@ ack@@ ling a really difficult problem.    
 If you are a gam@@ er, you will no@@ tice a few nu@@ anc@@ es her@@ e: the c@@ rin@@ k@@ le of the ey@@ es up, and around the m@@ outh is a sig@@ n of op@@ tim@@ ism, and the e@@ ye@@ b@@ row@@ s up is surpri@@ se.    
 This is a gam@@ er who's on the ver@@ ge of something called an "@@ epic win@@ ."    
   O@@ h, you've heard of that.    
 O@@ K@@ , goo@@ d, so we have some gam@@ ers am@@ ong us.    
 A@@ n epic win is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily posi@@ tive, you had no idea it was even possible until you achiev@@ ed it.    
 It was almost beyond the thre@@ sh@@ old of imagin@@ ation, and when you get there, you're sh@@ oc@@ ked to dis@@ co@@ ver what you're truly cap@@ able of.    
 That's an epic w@@ in.    
 This is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epic w@@ in.    
 on milli@@ ons of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s all over the world the face of someone wh@@ o, against all o@@ dd@@ s, is on the ver@@ ge of an epic w@@ in.    
 Now, un@@ fortun@@ ately this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s.    
 This is what I call the "I'm Not G@@ ood At Li@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e.    
 This is actually me making it.    
 Can you see@@ ? Y@@ es. Goo@@ d.    
 This is me making the "I'm Not G@@ ood At Li@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e.    
 This is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old neighbor@@ hood in B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y, Californi@@ a, where I did my P@@ h@@ D on why we're better in games than we are in real life.    
 And this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers ha@@ ve.    
 We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in gam@@ es.    
 I don't mean just good as in success@@ ful, al@@ though that's part of it.    
 We do achi@@ eve more in game worl@@ ds.    
 But I also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ters -- inspi@@ red to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ oper@@ ate.    
 And when we're in game worl@@ ds, I believe that many of us become the best ver@@ sion of ourselves -- the most likely to help at a mom@@ ent@@ 's no@@ tic@@ e, the most likely to s@@ tic@@ k with a problem as long at it ta@@ k@@ es, to get up after fail@@ ure and try again.    
 And in real life, when we face fail@@ u@@ re, when we conf@@ ront ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es, we often don't feel that way.    
 We feel over@@ com@@ e, we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ me@@ d, we feel an@@ x@@ i@@ ous, maybe de@@ pres@@ se@@ d, fru@@ str@@ ated or cy@@ n@@ ic@@ al.    
 We never have those feel@@ ings when we're playing gam@@ es, they just don't ex@@ ist in gam@@ es.    
 So that's what I wanted to study when I was a gradu@@ ate stud@@ ent.    
 What about games makes it impos@@ sible to feel that we can't achi@@ eve every@@ thing@@ ?    
 How can we take those feel@@ ings from games and app@@ ly them to real@@ -@@ world work@@ ?    
 So I looked at games like World of War@@ cra@@ f@@ t, which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ving environ@@ ment.    
 And I started to no@@ tice a few things that make epic win@@ s so possible in online worl@@ ds.    
 The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these online gam@@ es, especially in World of War@@ cra@@ f@@ t, there are lots and lots of different charac@@ ters who are willing to trust you with a worl@@ d-@@ sa@@ ving mis@@ sion, right a@@ way. But not just any mis@@ sion, it's a mis@@ sion that is perfec@@ tly mat@@ ched with your cur@@ ren@@ t level in the game.    
 Ri@@ ght? So you can do it.    
 They never give you a challenge you can't achiev@@ e.    
 But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you're cap@@ able of, so you have to try har@@ d.    
 But there's no u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment in World of War@@ cra@@ f@@ t@@ ; no sitting aroun@@ d, wr@@ ing@@ ing your hands -- there's always something speci@@ fic and important to be don@@ e.    
 There are also tons of collabor@@ ator@@ s.    
 Every@@ where you go@@ , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achi@@ eve your epic mis@@ sion.    
 That's not something we have in real life that eas@@ il@@ y, this sense that at our fing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ator@@ s.    
 And there's this epic story, this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we're there, and what we're do@@ ing, and we get all this posi@@ tive fe@@ ed@@ back.    
 You guys have heard of level@@ ing up, +@@ 1 st@@ ren@@ g@@ th, +@@ 1 intellig@@ ence.    
 We don't get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real life.    
 When I get off this st@@ age, I'm not going to have +@@ 1 spea@@ king, and +@@ 1 crazy idea@@ , +@@ 20 crazy idea@@ .    
 I don't get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real life.    
 Now, the problem with collabor@@ ative online environ@@ ments like World of War@@ cra@@ ft is that it's so satis@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epic win all the time, we dec@@ ide to spend all our time in these game worl@@ ds.    
 It's just better than real@@ ity.    
 So, so far@@ , collec@@ tively all the World of War@@ cra@@ ft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the virtu@@ al problems of A@@ zer@@ o@@ th.    
 Now, that's not necess@@ arily a bad thing.    
 It might sound like it's a bad thing.    
 But to put that in cont@@ ex@@ t@@ : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our earli@@ est pri@@ m@@ ate human anc@@ es@@ tors st@@ ood up.    
 That was the first up@@ right pri@@ mat@@ e.    
 So when we talk about how much time we're cur@@ ren@@ tly inv@@ es@@ ting in playing gam@@ es, the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evolu@@ tion, which is an extraordinary thing.    
 But it's also ap@@ t, because it turns out that by sp@@ ending all this time playing gam@@ es, we're actually changing what we are cap@@ able of as human be@@ ings.    
 We're ev@@ ol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty speci@@ es.    
 This is tru@@ e. I believe this.    
 So, consid@@ er this really interesting sta@@ tis@@ tic@@ ; it was rec@@ ently publi@@ sh@@ ed by a rese@@ arch@@ er at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on U@@ ni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y@@ : The average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10@@ ,000 hours playing online games by the age of 2@@ 1@@ .    
 Now 10@@ ,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reas@@ on@@ s.    
 Fir@@ st of all, for children in the United St@@ ates, 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 8@@ 0 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school, from fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de to high school gradu@@ ation, if you have perfect att@@ end@@ anc@@ e.    
 So, we have an entire par@@ al@@ le@@ l tr@@ ack of edu@@ cation going on, where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they're learning about everything else in school.    
 Some of you have probably read M@@ al@@ col@@ m G@@ la@@ d@@ well@@ 's new book "O@@ ut@@ li@@ er@@ s@@ ," so you would have heard of his theor@@ y of succ@@ ess, the "@@ 10@@ ,000 hour@@ s@@ " theor@@ y of succ@@ ess.    
 It's based on this great cog@@ ni@@ tiv@@ e-@@ science research that says if we can ma@@ ster 10@@ ,000 hours of eff@@ ort@@ ful study at anything by the age of 2@@ 1, we will be virtu@@ os@@ os at it.    
 We will be as good at what@@ ever we do as the greatest people in the world.    
 And so, now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ os@@ o gam@@ ers.    
 So, the big question is, "What exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at@@ ?"    
 Because if we could figure that out, we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ p@@ rec@@ ed@@ ent@@ ed human resour@@ ce on our han@@ ds.    
 This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online gam@@ es.    
 These are our virtu@@ os@@ o gam@@ ers, 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at some@@ thing.    
 And in the next deca@@ de, we're going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at what@@ ever that is.    
 If you don't know it al@@ read@@ y, this is com@@ ing.    
 The game indu@@ str@@ y is develop@@ ing con@@ sol@@ es that are low@@ -@@ energy and that work with the wi@@ re@@ less phone net@@ wor@@ ks instead of bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and Inter@@ ne@@ t, so that gam@@ ers all over the world, particularly in Indi@@ a, Chin@@ a, B@@ ra@@ z@@ il, can get on@@ lin@@ e.    
 They ex@@ pect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next deca@@ de.    
 It will bring us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers. So I've started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ os@@ os at.    
 Here are the four things I came up with@@ .    
 The first is ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ tim@@ ism.    
 O@@ K@@ , think of this as ex@@ tre@@ me self-@@ motiv@@ ation.    
 U@@ r@@ g@@ ent op@@ tim@@ ism is the des@@ i@@ re to act im@@ medi@@ ately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le, comb@@ ined with the beli@@ ef that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of succ@@ ess.    
 G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an epic win is possib@@ le, and that it's always worth tr@@ y@@ ing, and trying now.    
 G@@ am@@ ers don't s@@ it aroun@@ d.    
 G@@ am@@ ers are virtu@@ os@@ os at wea@@ ving a ti@@ ght social f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ .    
 There's a lot of interesting research that show@@ s we like people better after we play a game with them, even if they@@ 've be@@ at@@ en us b@@ ad@@ ly.    
 And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust to play a game with some@@ one.    
 We trust that they will spend their time with us, that they will play by the same rul@@ es, value the same go@@ al, sta@@ y with the game until it's over@@ .    
 And so, playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and trust and co@@ oper@@ ation.    
 And we actually build str@@ ong@@ er social relationshi@@ ps as a resul@@ t.    
 B@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity. I love it.    
 You know, there's a reason why the average World of War@@ cra@@ ft gam@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 hours a week -- kind of a hal@@ f@@ -@@ time job@@ .    
 It's because we know, when we're playing a gam@@ e, that we're actually happ@@ i@@ er working hard than we are rela@@ x@@ ing, or han@@ g@@ ing out.    
 We know that we are op@@ tim@@ ized as human be@@ ings, to do hard and mean@@ ing@@ ful work.    
 And gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time, if they're given the right work.    
 F@@ in@@ all@@ y@@ : epic mean@@ ing.    
 G@@ am@@ ers love to be att@@ ach@@ ed to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ scale stor@@ ies.    
 So, just one bit of tri@@ vi@@ a that hel@@ ps put that into perspec@@ tiv@@ e: So, you all know Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a, biggest wi@@ k@@ i in the world.    
 S@@ econ@@ d biggest wi@@ k@@ i in the world, with nearly 80@@ ,000 ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es, is the World of War@@ cra@@ ft wi@@ ki@@ .    
 F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th.    
 They have comp@@ il@@ ed more information about World of War@@ cra@@ ft on the Inter@@ net than any other top@@ ic cover@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world.    
 They are building an epic story.    
 They are building an epic knowledge resour@@ ce about the World of War@@ cra@@ f@@ t.    
 Oka@@ y, so these are four super@@ pow@@ ers that ad@@ d up to one thing@@ : G@@ am@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ power@@ ed hop@@ e@@ ful individu@@ als.    
 These are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally cap@@ able of changing the world.    
 And the only problem is, they believe that they are cap@@ able of changing virtu@@ al worl@@ ds and not the real world.    
 That's the problem that I'm trying to sol@@ ve.    
 There's an econom@@ ist nam@@ ed E@@ d@@ ward C@@ a@@ str@@ on@@ o@@ v@@ a. H@@ is work is br@@ illi@@ ant.    
 He looks at why people are inv@@ es@@ ting so much time and energy and money in online worl@@ ds.    
 And he says, "@@ We're wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what amoun@@ ts to no less than a ma@@ ss ex@@ o@@ d@@ us to virtu@@ al worl@@ ds and online game environ@@ ment@@ s."    
 And he's an econom@@ ist@@ , so he's ra@@ tion@@ al.    
 And he says -- Not like me, I'm a game desig@@ ner@@ ; I'm ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant.    
 But he says that this makes perfect sen@@ se, because gam@@ ers can achi@@ eve more in online worl@@ ds than they can in real life.    
 They can have str@@ ong@@ er social relationshi@@ ps in games than they can have in real life@@ ; they get better fe@@ ed@@ back and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life.    
 So he says, for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtu@@ al worl@@ ds than the real world.    
 Now, I also ag@@ ree that that is ra@@ tion@@ al, for now.    
 But it is not, by any mean@@ s, an op@@ ti@@ mal situ@@ ation.    
 We have to start making the real world work more like a game.    
 I take my inspi@@ ra@@ tion from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago.    
 These are ancient dic@@ e, made out of she@@ ep@@ 's k@@ n@@ uck@@ les.    
 Be@@ fore we had aw@@ es@@ ome game contro@@ ll@@ ers, we had she@@ ep@@ 's k@@ n@@ uck@@ les.    
 And these re@@ present the first game e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment and if you're famili@@ ar with the work of the ancient G@@ ree@@ k hi@@ stor@@ ian H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, you might know this hi@@ story, which is the history of who invent@@ ed games and wh@@ y.    
 H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ tu@@ s says that gam@@ es, particularly di@@ ce gam@@ es, were invent@@ ed in the k@@ ing@@ dom of L@@ y@@ di@@ a, during a time of fam@@ ine.    
 A@@ pp@@ aren@@ t@@ ly, there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ di@@ a decided they had to do something craz@@ y.    
 People were suffer@@ ing. People were fi@@ ght@@ ing.    
 It was an ex@@ tre@@ me situ@@ ation, they needed an ex@@ tre@@ me solu@@ tion.    
 So, acc@@ or@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, they invent@@ ed di@@ ce gam@@ es, and they set up a k@@ ing@@ dom@@ -@@ w@@ ide polic@@ y@@ : On one day, everybody would e@@ at, and on the next day, everybody would play gam@@ es.    
 And they would be so im@@ mer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce gam@@ es, because games are so eng@@ ag@@ ing, and im@@ mer@@ se us in such satis@@ f@@ y@@ ing, b@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity, they would ig@@ nor@@ e the fact that they had no food to e@@ at.    
 And then on the next day, they would play gam@@ es@@ ; and on the next day, they would e@@ at.    
 And acc@@ or@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, they pas@@ sed 1@@ 8 years this way, survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine, by e@@ ating on one day, and playing games on the nex@@ t.    
 Now, this is exac@@ t@@ ly, I think, how we're using games today.    
 We're using games to es@@ cap@@ e real@@ -@@ world suffer@@ ing -- we're using games to get away from everything that's bro@@ ken in the real environ@@ ment, everything that's not satis@@ f@@ ying about real life, and we're getting what we need from gam@@ es.    
 But it doesn't have to end there.    
 This is really exc@@ it@@ ing.    
 A@@ cc@@ or@@ ding to H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us, after 1@@ 8 years the fam@@ ine wasn't getting bet@@ ter, so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al di@@ ce game.    
 They di@@ vid@@ ed the entire k@@ ing@@ dom in hal@@ f@@ .    
 They play@@ ed one di@@ ce gam@@ e, and the win@@ n@@ ers of that game got to go on an epic ad@@ ven@@ ture.    
 They would leave L@@ y@@ di@@ a, and they would go out in se@@ arch of a new place to liv@@ e, lea@@ ving behind just enough people to survi@@ ve on the resour@@ ces that were avail@@ able, and hop@@ e@@ fully to take their ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation some@@ where else where they could th@@ ri@@ ve.    
 Now, this soun@@ ds craz@@ y, right?    
 But rec@@ ent@@ ly, DN@@ A evidence has shown that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ can@@ s, who then led to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ mp@@ i@@ re, actually share the same DN@@ A as the ancient L@@ y@@ di@@ an@@ s.    
 And so, rec@@ ent@@ ly, scientists have sugg@@ es@@ ted that H@@ er@@ o@@ do@@ t@@ us@@ ' crazy story is actually tru@@ e.    
 And ge@@ o@@ logi@@ sts have found evidence of a global co@@ ol@@ ing that la@@ sted for nearly 20 years, that could have expla@@ ined the fam@@ ine.    
 So this crazy story might be tru@@ e.    
 They might have actually sa@@ ved their culture by playing gam@@ es, es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 1@@ 8 years, and then been so inspi@@ re@@ d, and knew so much about how to come together with gam@@ es, that they actually sa@@ ved the entire ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation that way.    
 Oka@@ y, we can do that.    
 We've been playing War@@ cra@@ ft since 19@@ 9@@ 4@@ .    
 That was the first real@@ -@@ time str@@ at@@ eg@@ y game from the World of War@@ cra@@ ft seri@@ es.    
 That was 1@@ 6 years ago. They play@@ ed di@@ ce games for 1@@ 8 years, we've been playing War@@ cra@@ ft for 1@@ 6 years.    
 I say we are ready for our own epic game.    
 Now, they had half the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation go off in se@@ arch of a new world, so that's where I get my 2@@ 1 billion hours a week of gam@@ e-@@ play from@@ .    
 Let's get half of us to ag@@ ree to spend an hour a day playing gam@@ es, until we solve real@@ -@@ world problem@@ s.    
 Now, I know you're as@@ king, "@@ How are we going to solve real@@ -@@ world problems in gam@@ es@@ ?"    
 Well, that's what I've de@@ vo@@ ted my work to over the past few years, at the In@@ stitu@@ te for the F@@ u@@ ture.    
 We have this ban@@ ner in our offic@@ es in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to, and it ex@@ pres@@ ses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the fu@@ ture.    
 We do not want to try to pre@@ di@@ ct the fu@@ ture.    
 What we want to do is make the fu@@ ture.    
 We want to imagine the b@@ est@@ -@@ case scen@@ ari@@ o out@@ com@@ e, and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a real@@ ity.    
 We want to imagine epic win@@ s, and then give people the means to achi@@ eve the epic w@@ in.    
 I'm just going to very bri@@ e@@ f@@ ly show you three games that I've made that are an at@@ temp@@ t to give people the means to create epic win@@ s in their own fu@@ ture@@ s.    
 This is World Wi@@ th@@ out O@@ il.    
 We made this game in 200@@ 7@@ .    
 in which you try to survi@@ ve an o@@ il shor@@ ta@@ g@@ e.    
 The o@@ il shor@@ ta@@ ge is fic@@ tion@@ al, but we put enough online cont@@ ent out there for you to believe that it's real@@ , and to live your real life as if we've run out of o@@ il.    
 So when you come to the gam@@ e, you sig@@ n up, tell us where you liv@@ e, and then we give you real@@ -@@ time news vide@@ o@@ s, data fe@@ eds that show you exactly how much o@@ il co@@ sts, what's not avail@@ able, how food supp@@ ly is being affec@@ ted, how transp@@ or@@ ta@@ tion is being affec@@ ted, if school@@ s are close@@ d, if there's ri@@ o@@ ting, and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were tru@@ e. And then we ask you to b@@ lo@@ g about it,    
 to p@@ ost vide@@ o@@ s, to p@@ ost photo@@ s.    
 We pi@@ lo@@ ted this game with 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 play@@ ers in 200@@ 7@@ , and we've trac@@ ked them for the three years sin@@ ce.    
 And I can tell you that this is a trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tive experienc@@ e.    
 No@@ body wan@@ ts to change how they liv@@ e, just because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to.    
 But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an epic ad@@ ven@@ ture and tell them, "@@ We've run out of o@@ il.    
 This is an amazing story and ad@@ ven@@ ture for you to go on.    
 Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge your@@ self to see how you would survi@@ ve@@ ," most of our play@@ ers have k@@ ept up the ha@@ b@@ its that they learned in this game.    
 So for the next worl@@ d-@@ sa@@ ving gam@@ e, we decided to ai@@ m high@@ er -- bigg@@ er problem than just pe@@ a@@ k o@@ il.    
 We did a game called Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the In@@ stitu@@ te for the F@@ u@@ ture.    
 And the pre@@ mis@@ e was, a super@@ computer has cal@@ cul@@ ated that human@@ s have only 2@@ 3 years left on the planet.    
 This super@@ computer was called the G@@ lo@@ bal E@@ x@@ tin@@ c@@ tion A@@ wa@@ ren@@ ess S@@ y@@ stem@@ , of cour@@ se.    
 We asked people to come online -- almost like a J@@ er@@ ry Br@@ uck@@ he@@ im@@ er movi@@ e.    
 You know J@@ er@@ ry Br@@ uck@@ he@@ im@@ er movi@@ es, you form a dream team -- you've got the a@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ t, the scienti@@ st, the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vic@@ t, and they all have something to do to save the world.    
   But in our gam@@ e, instead of just having five people on the dream te@@ am, we said, "@@ Every@@ bod@@ y's on the dream te@@ am, and it's your job to inv@@ ent the future of energ@@ y, the future of food, the future of heal@@ th, the future of se@@ cur@@ ity and the future of the social sa@@ fe@@ ty net@@ ."    
 We had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight wee@@ ks.    
 They came up with 500 in@@ s@@ an@@ ely creative solu@@ tions that you can go on@@ lin@@ e, Goog@@ le "@@ Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t@@ ," and se@@ e.    
 So, finally, the last gam@@ e, we're la@@ un@@ ching it M@@ arch 3@@ r@@ d. This is a game done with the World B@@ ank In@@ stitu@@ t@@ e.    
 If you comple@@ te the gam@@ e, you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the World B@@ ank In@@ stitu@@ te as a S@@ o@@ ci@@ al In@@ no@@ v@@ at@@ or, class of 20@@ 10@@ .    
 Wor@@ king with univer@@ si@@ ties all over sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Afri@@ ca, and we are inv@@ iting them to learn social inno@@ v@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s.    
 in sk@@ ill@@ s like local in@@ si@@ ght, knowledge net@@ work@@ ing, sustain@@ ab@@ il@@ ity, vi@@ sion and resour@@ c@@ e@@ ful@@ n@@ ess.    
 I would like to inv@@ ite all of you to please share this game with young people, any@@ where in the world, particularly in develop@@ ing are@@ as, who might bene@@ fit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pri@@ ses to save the world.    
 So, I'm going to w@@ ra@@ p up now.    
 I want to ask a ques@@ tion.    
 What do you think happens nex@@ t?    
 We've got all these amazing gam@@ ers, we've got these games that are kind of pi@@ lots of what we might do, but n@@ one of them have sa@@ ved the real world ye@@ t.    
 Well I hope you will ag@@ ree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resour@@ ce that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world work, that games are a powerful pl@@ at@@ form for change.    
 We have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s: b@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity, the ability to wea@@ ve a ti@@ ght social f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ , this feeling of ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ tim@@ ism and the des@@ i@@ re for epic mean@@ ing.    
 I really hope that we can come together to play games that mat@@ ter, to survi@@ ve on this plan@@ et for another centur@@ y.    
 That's my hop@@ e, that you will jo@@ in me in making and playing games like this.    
 When I look forward to the next deca@@ de, I know two things for su@@ re@@ : that we can make any future we can imagin@@ e, and we can play any games we wan@@ t, so I say@@ : L@@ et the worl@@ d-@@ changing games beg@@ in.    
 Thank you.    
 For some time I have been interested in the plac@@ eb@@ o effec@@ t, which might seem like an o@@ d@@ d thing for a mag@@ ic@@ ian to be interested in, un@@ less you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "@@ Some@@ thing fa@@ ke is believ@@ ed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real@@ ."    
 In other words, su@@ g@@ ar p@@ ill@@ s have a meas@@ ur@@ able effec@@ t in certain kinds of stu@@ di@@ es, the plac@@ eb@@ o effec@@ t, just because the person thin@@ ks that what's happen@@ ing to them is a ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pa@@ in man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment, for example, if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effec@@ t in the body called the plac@@ eb@@ o effec@@ t.    
 Some@@ thing fa@@ ke becomes something real because of some@@ one's perc@@ ep@@ tion of it.    
 In order for us to understand each other@@ , I want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ar@@ y, very simple magic tric@@ k.    
 And I'm going to show you how it work@@ s. This is a tri@@ ck that's been in every children@@ 's magic book since at least the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s.    
 I learned it myself from C@@ u@@ b S@@ c@@ out M@@ ag@@ ic in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s.    
 I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.    
 And then I'll explain why I expla@@ ined it.    
 So, here's what happen@@ s.    
 The k@@ ni@@ f@@ e, which you can exam@@ ine@@ ; my han@@ d, which you could exam@@ ine.    
 I'm just going to hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this.    
 I'll get my sle@@ eve back.    
 And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve I'm just going to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze my w@@ ri@@ st right here.    
 That way you can see that at no time can anything tra@@ vel@@ , as long as I'm squ@@ e@@ e@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e.    
 And the objec@@ t of this is quite simp@@ le.    
 I'm going to open my han@@ d, and hop@@ e@@ ful@@ ly, if all is well, my pu@@ re ani@@ mal magne@@ tis@@ m will hold the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e.    
 In fact it's hel@@ d so ti@@ ght@@ ly in place that I can sha@@ ke it, and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off.    
 No@@ thing goes up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e, no tric@@ k@@ er@@ y. And you can exam@@ ine every@@ thing.    
 T@@ a@@ -@@ da@@ !    
   So, this is a tri@@ ck that I often teach to young children that are interested in mag@@ ic, because you can learn a great deal about de@@ cep@@ tion by stud@@ ying this very -- even though it's a very simple tri@@ ck me@@ tho@@ do@@ log@@ ic@@ ally.    
 P@@ rob@@ ably many of you in the room know this tric@@ k.    
 What happens is this.    
 I hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my han@@ d.    
 I say I'm going to gra@@ b hold of my w@@ ri@@ st to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e, that is a li@@ e.    
 The reason I'm hol@@ ding onto my w@@ ri@@ st is because that's actually the secre@@ t of the ill@@ usi@@ on.    
 In a moment when my hand mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being away from you, this fing@@ er right here, my in@@ de@@ x fing@@ er is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is, to a posi@@ tion poin@@ ting out like this.    
 N@@ ice one.    
 Some@@ one who didn't have a child@@ hood is out there.    
   So, it goes like this, from here, right.    
 And as I move around my fing@@ er shi@@ f@@ ts.    
 And we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive, why you don't no@@ tice there are only three fing@@ ers down here, because the min@@ d, and the way it process@@ es informa@@ tion, it doesn't coun@@ t, one, tw@@ o, thre@@ e. It grou@@ ps them.    
 But that's not really what this is ab@@ out. Ri@@ ght? And then I open my hand up.    
 O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously it's cl@@ ing@@ ing there, not by ani@@ mal magne@@ ti@@ sm@@ , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y, my in@@ de@@ x fing@@ er being there.    
 And then when I close my fing@@ er, same thing, as I move back, this mo@@ tion kind of cover@@ s the moving back of my fing@@ er.    
 I take this hand a@@ way. You give the k@@ ni@@ fe out.    
 There is a tri@@ ck you can do for your friends and neighbor@@ s. Th@@ an@@ ks.    
 Now, what does that have to do with the plac@@ eb@@ o effec@@ t?    
 I read a study a year or so ago that really b@@ le@@ w my mind w@@ ide op@@ en.    
 I'm not a doctor or a rese@@ arch@@ er, so this, to me, was an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing thing.    
 It turns out that if you ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er a plac@@ eb@@ o in the form of a white p@@ ill@@ , that's like as@@ p@@ ir@@ in sha@@ ped -- it's just a rou@@ nd white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effec@@ t.    
 But if you change the form that you give the plac@@ eb@@ o in, like you make a sm@@ all@@ er p@@ ill@@ , and color it bl@@ u@@ e, and st@@ am@@ p a let@@ ter into it, it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effec@@ tive.    
 E@@ ven though nei@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical -- they're su@@ g@@ ar p@@ ill@@ s.    
 But a white p@@ ill is not as good as a bl@@ ue p@@ ill@@ .    
 Wh@@ at@@ ? That really f@@ li@@ pped me out.    
 T@@ ur@@ ns out thou@@ gh, that that's not even where it stop@@ s.    
 If you have cap@@ sul@@ es, they're more effec@@ tive than tab@@ le@@ ts in any for@@ m.    
 A co@@ lo@@ red cap@@ su@@ le, that's y@@ el@@ low on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le.    
 D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this.    
 One p@@ ill tw@@ ice a day is not as good at three p@@ ill@@ s -- I don't remember the sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ c now. S@@ or@@ r@@ y.    
 But the point is ...    
  ... these d@@ os@@ ages have something to do with it.    
 And the form has something to do with it.    
 And if you want the ultim@@ ate in plac@@ e@@ bo@@ , you've go to the need@@ le.    
 Ri@@ ght? A sy@@ r@@ ing@@ e with some in@@ er@@ t -- a couple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ er@@ t some@@ thing, and you in@@ jec@@ t this into a pati@@ ent ...    
 Well this is such a powerful image in their min@@ d, it's so much str@@ ong@@ er than the white p@@ ill@@ .    
 It's a re@@ ally, this graph@@ , well I'll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ d@@ es.    
 The point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the bl@@ ue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the need@@ le.    
 And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ace@@ u@@ tical qu@@ al@@ ity, it's only your beli@@ ef that makes it real in your body and makes a str@@ ong@@ er effec@@ t.    
 I wanted to see if I could take that idea and app@@ ly it to a magic tric@@ k.    
 And take something that is obvi@@ ously a fa@@ ke tri@@ ck and make it seem real@@ .    
 And we know from that study that when you want real@@ ity, you go to the need@@ le.    
 This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch h@@ at@@ p@@ in. It's very, very sh@@ ar@@ p, and I'm going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tiny b@@ it.    
 This is really my fl@@ es@@ h. This is not D@@ am@@ i@@ an@@ 's speci@@ al@@ -@@ grow@@ n fl@@ es@@ h.    
 That's my sk@@ in right there. This is not a Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood speci@@ al effec@@ t.    
 I'm going to pi@@ er@@ ce my sk@@ in and run this need@@ le through to the other sid@@ e.    
 If you're qu@@ easy -- if you fa@@ in@@ t eas@@ ily -- I was doing this for some friends in the ho@@ te@@ l room last night, and some people that I didn't know, and one woman almost pas@@ sed out.    
 So, I sugg@@ est if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact, you know what@@ , I'll do the first bad part behind it.    
 You@@ 'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.    
 So, here is what happen@@ s, right here, the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the low@@ er part of my ar@@ m I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce.    
 I'm sor@@ r@@ y, man@@ . A@@ m I f@@ rea@@ king you out@@ ?    
 O@@ K@@ , and then just through my sk@@ in a tiny b@@ it, and then out the other side like this.    
 Now, ess@@ entially we're in the same posi@@ tion we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe tric@@ k.    
   S@@ ort of.    
 But you can't coun@@ t my fing@@ ers right now can you@@ ?    
 So, let me show them to you. That's one, two thre@@ e, four@@ , fi@@ ve.    
 Y@@ es, well@@ ...    
 I know what people think when they see this.    
 They go@@ , "Well, he's certainly not du@@ m@@ b enough to sta@@ b hi@@ m@@ self through the sk@@ in to enter@@ tain us for a few minut@@ es.    
 So, let me give you a little pe@@ e@@ k.    
 H@@ ow@@ 's that look out ther@@ e? P@@ re@@ t@@ ty goo@@ d.    
   Yea@@ h, I know. And the people in the back go@@ , "O@@ K@@ , I didn't really see that@@ ."    
 People in the s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite room are starting to move in now.    
 L@@ et me give you good close look at this.    
 That really is my sk@@ in. That is not a Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood speci@@ al effec@@ t.    
 That's my fl@@ es@@ h, and I can tw@@ ist that aroun@@ d.    
 I'm sor@@ r@@ y. If you're getting qu@@ eas@@ y, look away, don't look at the thing.    
 People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go@@ , "@@ Well yea@@ h, that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effec@@ t there, but if it were real he would be -- see there's a ho@@ le there and a ho@@ le there, if it were real he would be b@@ le@@ ed@@ ing.    
 Well let me work up some blood for you.    
   Y@@ es, there it is.    
     Nor@@ m@@ ally now, I would take the need@@ le out.    
 I would clean off my ar@@ m, and I would show you that there are no w@@ oun@@ ds.    
 But I think in this cont@@ ext and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real@@ , I'm just going to leave it there, and walk off the st@@ age.    
   I will be seeing you several times over the next few day@@ s.    
 I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.    
 So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.    
 I've loved only tw@@ o.    
 That first one, it was more like a pas@@ sion@@ ate aff@@ air@@ .    
 It was a beautiful fish@@ : fla@@ vor@@ ful, t@@ ex@@ ture@@ d, me@@ at@@ y, a b@@ est@@ sel@@ l@@ er on the men@@ u@@ .    
   E@@ ven bet@@ ter, it was far@@ m@@ -@@ rais@@ ed to the supposed high@@ est stan@@ dar@@ ds of sustain@@ ab@@ ility. So you could feel good about sel@@ ling it.    
 I was in a relationship with this beau@@ ty for several month@@ s.    
 One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an ev@@ ent about the far@@ m@@ 's sustain@@ ab@@ ility.    
 "A@@ b@@ solu@@ tel@@ y@@ ," I said@@ .    
 Here was a company trying to solve what's become this un@@ imagin@@ able problem for us che@@ f@@ s: How do we keep fish on our men@@ us@@ ?    
 For the past 50 years, we've been fish@@ ing the se@@ as like we c@@ lear@@ -@@ c@@ ut fore@@ st@@ s.    
 It's hard to over@@ state the des@@ truc@@ tion.    
 N@@ ine@@ ty percent of large fish@@ , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as, the h@@ ali@@ bu@@ ts, the sal@@ mon@@ s, s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they@@ 've col@@ la@@ p@@ se@@ d.    
 There's almost nothing lef@@ t.    
 So, for better or for wor@@ se, a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture, fish far@@ m@@ ing, is going to be a part of our fu@@ ture.    
 A lot of argu@@ ments against it@@ : F@@ ish far@@ ms pol@@ lu@@ te -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they're in@@ eff@@ ici@@ ent. T@@ a@@ ke tun@@ a, a maj@@ or dra@@ w@@ back.    
 It's got a feed conver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o of 15 to one.    
 That means it takes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en p@@ oun@@ ds of w@@ il@@ d fish to get you one p@@ ound of farm tun@@ a.    
 Not very sustain@@ able.    
 It doesn't ta@@ ste very good ei@@ ther@@ .    
 So here, finally, was a company trying to do it right.    
 I wanted to supp@@ ort them.    
 The day before the ev@@ ent, I called the head of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the compan@@ y.    
 Let's call him D@@ on.    
 "D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ just to get the fac@@ ts stra@@ i@@ ght, you guys are fam@@ ous for far@@ m@@ ing so far out to se@@ a, you don't pol@@ lu@@ te@@ ."    
 "@@ That's ri@@ ght@@ ," he said@@ . "@@ We're so far out, the wa@@ ste from our fish gets di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted, not con@@ cent@@ r@@ at@@ ed@@ ."    
 And then he ad@@ ded, "@@ We're basically a world un@@ to our@@ selves.    
 That feed conver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o@@ ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to one@@ ," he said@@ .    
 "@@ B@@ est in the busin@@ ess@@ ."    
 2@@ .@@ 5 to one, great@@ .    
 "@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 what@@ ? What are you fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ ?"    
 "@@ Su@@ stain@@ able prote@@ in@@ s@@ ," he said@@ .    
 "@@ Gre@@ at@@ ," I said@@ . Go@@ t off the ph@@ one.    
 And that night, I was l@@ ying in be@@ d, and I thou@@ ght@@ : What the hel@@ l is a sustain@@ able prote@@ in@@ ?    
   So the next day, just before the ev@@ ent, I called D@@ on.    
 I said, "D@@ on, what are some exam@@ ples of sustain@@ able prote@@ in@@ s@@ ?"    
 He said he didn't know. He would ask aroun@@ d.    
 Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the comp@@ any@@ ; no one could give me a stra@@ ight answer until finally, I got on the phone with the head bio@@ logi@@ st.    
 Let's call him D@@ on too@@ .    
   "D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ what are some exam@@ ples of sustain@@ able prote@@ in@@ s@@ ?"    
 Well, he men@@ tion@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als, and then he said ch@@ ic@@ ken p@@ el@@ le@@ ts.    
 I said, "@@ Ch@@ ic@@ ken p@@ el@@ let@@ s@@ ?"    
 He said, "@@ Yea@@ h, fe@@ a@@ ther@@ s, sk@@ in, b@@ one me@@ al, sc@@ ra@@ ps, dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into fe@@ ed@@ ."    
 I said, "What perc@@ ent@@ age of your feed is ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en@@ ?"    
 Th@@ in@@ king, you know, two perc@@ ent.    
 "Well, it's about 30 perc@@ ent@@ ," he said@@ .    
 I said, "D@@ on, what's sustain@@ able about fe@@ e@@ ding ch@@ ic@@ ken to fish@@ ?"    
   There was a long pa@@ use on the lin@@ e, and he said, "@@ There's just too much ch@@ ic@@ ken in the world@@ ."    
   I f@@ ell out of love with this fish@@ .    
   No, not because I'm some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous, I actually am.    
   No, I actually f@@ ell out of love with this fish be@@ cause, I s@@ wear to Go@@ d, after that conversa@@ tion, the fish ta@@ sted like ch@@ ic@@ k@@ en.    
   This second fish@@ , it's a different kind of love story.    
 It's the rom@@ an@@ tic kin@@ d, the kind where the more you get to know your fish@@ , you love the fish@@ .    
 I first ate it at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in sou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in.    
 A jour@@ nal@@ ist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.    
 She kind of set us up.    
   It came to the table a bri@@ ght, almost sh@@ im@@ mer@@ ing, white col@@ or.    
 The ch@@ ef had over@@ c@@ oo@@ ked it.    
 Li@@ ke tw@@ ice over@@ .    
 A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly, it was still deli@@ ci@@ ous.    
 Who can make a fish ta@@ ste good after it's been over@@ c@@ oo@@ ke@@ d?    
 I can@@ '@@ t, but this guy can@@ .    
 Let's call him Mi@@ gu@@ el -- actually his name is Mi@@ gu@@ el@@ .    
   And no@@ , he didn't c@@ oo@@ k the fish@@ , and he's not a che@@ f@@ , at least in the way that you and I understand it.    
 It's a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ w@@ es@@ ter@@ n cor@@ ner of S@@ pa@@ in.    
 It's at the ti@@ p of the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver.    
 Un@@ til the 19@@ 80@@ s, the farm was in the hands of the Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ ini@@ an@@ s.    
 They rais@@ ed be@@ ef cat@@ tle on what was ess@@ entially we@@ t@@ lan@@ ds.    
 They did it by dra@@ ining the lan@@ d.    
 They built this in@@ tric@@ ate ser@@ ies of can@@ als, and they push@@ ed water off the land and out into the ri@@ ver.    
 Well, they couldn't make it work, not econom@@ ic@@ ally.    
 And ec@@ o@@ log@@ ic@@ ally, it was a disa@@ st@@ er.    
 It killed like 9@@ 0 percent of the bir@@ ds, And so in 19@@ 8@@ 2@@ , a S@@ pan@@ ish company with an environ@@ mental consci@@ ence pur@@ cha@@ sed the lan@@ d.    
 What did they do@@ ?    
 They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ low of water.    
 They literally f@@ li@@ pped the s@@ wit@@ ch.    
 Instea@@ d of push@@ ing water out, they used the chan@@ n@@ el@@ s to pul@@ l water back in.    
 They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als.    
 They created a 2@@ 7@@ ,00@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re fish farm -- bas@@ s, mul@@ le@@ t, sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ , e@@ el -- and in the proc@@ ess, Mi@@ gu@@ el and this company completely re@@ vers@@ ed the ec@@ o@@ logical des@@ truc@@ tion.    
 The far@@ m@@ 's incredi@@ b@@ le.    
 I mean, you've never seen anything like this.    
 You st@@ are out at a hor@@ iz@@ on that is a million miles away, and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ic@@ k, rich mar@@ sh@@ lan@@ d.    
 I was there not long ago with Mi@@ gu@@ el@@ .    
 H@@ e's an amazing gu@@ y, like three par@@ ts Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ win and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e.    
   Oka@@ y? There we are s@@ log@@ g@@ ing through the we@@ t@@ lan@@ ds, and I'm pan@@ ting and s@@ we@@ at@@ ing, got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es, and Mi@@ gu@@ el@@ 's cal@@ m@@ ly con@@ duc@@ ting a bio@@ logy lec@@ ture.    
 H@@ er@@ e, he's poin@@ ting out a r@@ are B@@ l@@ ack@@ -@@ sh@@ oul@@ der@@ ed K@@ it@@ e.    
 Now, he's men@@ tion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on.    
 And here, here he se@@ es a grou@@ ping patter@@ n that re@@ min@@ ds him of the T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ an G@@ i@@ ra@@ ff@@ e.    
 It turns out, Mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his care@@ er in the Mi@@ k@@ um@@ i Na@@ tional Par@@ k in Afri@@ ca@@ .    
 I asked him how he became such an exper@@ t on fish@@ .    
 He said, "@@ F@@ ish@@ ? I didn't know anything about fish@@ .    
 I'm an exper@@ t in relationshi@@ p@@ s."    
 And then he's off@@ , la@@ un@@ ching into more talk about r@@ are bir@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and str@@ ange a@@ qu@@ a@@ tic plan@@ ts.    
 And don't get me wr@@ ong, that was really fascin@@ at@@ ing, you know, the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ u@@ g@@ ge@@ d, kind of thing.    
 It's great@@ , but I was in lo@@ ve.    
 And my head was s@@ w@@ o@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ c@@ oo@@ ked piece of deli@@ ci@@ ous fish I had the ni@@ ght before.    
 So I inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted him. I said, "@@ Mi@@ gu@@ el, what makes your fish ta@@ ste so goo@@ d@@ ?"    
 He poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e.    
 "I know, du@@ de, the al@@ ga@@ e, the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the relationshi@@ p@@ s: It's ama@@ z@@ ing.    
 But what are your fish e@@ at@@ ing?    
 What's the feed conver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o@@ ?"    
 Well, he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are e@@ ating what they@@ 'd be e@@ ating in the w@@ il@@ d.    
 The plant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s, the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the z@@ o@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on, it's what fe@@ eds the fish@@ .    
 The system is so health@@ y, it's totally self-@@ re@@ new@@ ing.    
 There is no fe@@ ed.    
 E@@ ver heard of a farm that doesn't feed its anim@@ al@@ s?    
 L@@ at@@ er that day, I was dri@@ ving around this proper@@ ty with Mi@@ gu@@ el, and I asked him, I said, "@@ For a place that seems so n@@ atur@@ al, un@@ like like any farm I'd ever been at, how do you measure success@@ ?"    
 At that mom@@ ent, it was as if a film direc@@ tor called for a set change.    
 And we rou@@ n@@ ded the cor@@ ner and saw the most amazing si@@ ght@@ : thousands and thousands of p@@ ink fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, a liter@@ al p@@ ink car@@ pe@@ t for as far as you could se@@ e.    
 "@@ That's success@@ ," he said@@ .    
 "@@ L@@ oo@@ k at their bel@@ li@@ es, p@@ in@@ k.    
 They're fe@@ ast@@ ing@@ ."    
 F@@ ea@@ st@@ ing? I was totally conf@@ us@@ ed.    
 I said, "@@ Mi@@ gu@@ el, aren't they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish@@ ?"    
   "@@ Y@@ es@@ ," he said@@ .    
   "@@ We lo@@ se 20 percent of our fish and fish e@@ gg@@ s to bir@@ ds.    
 Well, last year, this proper@@ ty had 6@@ 00@@ ,000 bir@@ ds on it, more than 2@@ 50 different speci@@ es.    
 It's be@@ com@@ e, today, the larg@@ est and one of the most important pri@@ v@@ ate bir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ ies in all of E@@ uro@@ pe@@ ."    
 I said, "@@ Mi@@ gu@@ el, isn't a th@@ ri@@ ving bir@@ d popula@@ tion like the last thing you want on a fish far@@ m@@ ?"    
   He sh@@ oo@@ k his hea@@ d, no@@ .    
 He said, "@@ We farm ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y, not in@@ ten@@ si@@ vel@@ y.    
 This is an ec@@ o@@ logical net@@ work.    
 The fl@@ am@@ ing@@ os e@@ at the sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ .    
 The sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p e@@ at the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ t@@ on.    
 So the p@@ in@@ k@@ er the b@@ ell@@ y, the better the system@@ ."    
 Oka@@ y, so let's re@@ view@@ : a farm that doesn't feed its anim@@ als, and a farm that meas@@ u@@ res its success on the health of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s.    
 A fish far@@ m, but also a bir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary.    
 O@@ h, and by the way, those fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, they sh@@ ouldn't even be there in the first plac@@ e.    
 They bro@@ od in a town 1@@ 50 miles away, where the so@@ il condi@@ tions are better for building n@@ es@@ ts.    
 Every morning, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 miles into the far@@ m.    
 And every even@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 miles back.    
   They do that because they're able to follow the bro@@ ken white line of high@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2@@ .    
   No kid@@ d@@ ing.    
 I was imagin@@ ing a "@@ M@@ arch of the P@@ en@@ gu@@ in@@ s@@ " thing, so I looked at Mi@@ gu@@ el@@ .    
 I said, "@@ Mi@@ gu@@ el, do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 miles to the far@@ m, and then do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 miles back at ni@@ ght?    
 Do they do that for the children@@ ?"    
 He looked at me like I had just qu@@ o@@ ted a Wh@@ it@@ ney H@@ ou@@ st@@ on s@@ ong@@ .    
   He said, "@@ No@@ ; they do it because the foo@@ d@@ 's bet@@ ter@@ ."    
   I didn't men@@ tion the sk@@ in of my bel@@ o@@ ved fish@@ , which was deli@@ ci@@ ous -- and I don't like fish sk@@ in@@ ; I don't like it se@@ are@@ d, I don't like it cri@@ sp@@ y.    
 It's that ac@@ ri@@ d, tar@@ -@@ like fla@@ v@@ or.    
 I almost never c@@ oo@@ k with it.    
 Y@@ e@@ t, when I ta@@ sted it at that re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in sou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in, it ta@@ sted not at all like fish sk@@ in.    
 It ta@@ sted s@@ we@@ et and cle@@ an, like you were taking a b@@ ite of the oce@@ an.    
 I men@@ tion@@ ed that to Mi@@ gu@@ el, and he no@@ d@@ de@@ d.    
 He said, "The sk@@ in ac@@ ts like a sp@@ ong@@ e.    
 It's the last def@@ en@@ se before anything ent@@ ers the bod@@ y.    
 It ev@@ ol@@ ved to so@@ a@@ k up imp@@ u@@ ri@@ ti@@ es@@ ."    
 And then he ad@@ ded, "@@ But our water has no imp@@ u@@ ri@@ ti@@ es@@ ."    
 O@@ K@@ . A farm that doesn't feed its fish@@ , a farm that meas@@ u@@ res its success by the success of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s.    
 And then I realized when he says, "@@ A farm that has no imp@@ u@@ ri@@ ti@@ es@@ ," he made a big underst@@ at@@ em@@ ent, because the water that flow@@ s through that farm comes in from the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r Ri@@ ver.    
 It's a ri@@ ver that car@@ ri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ ver@@ s t@@ end to car@@ ry these day@@ s: chemical cont@@ am@@ in@@ an@@ ts, p@@ es@@ tic@@ ide ru@@ no@@ ff@@ .    
 And when it wor@@ ks its way through the system and lea@@ ves, the water is cle@@ an@@ er than when it enter@@ ed.    
 The system is so health@@ y, it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water.    
 So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its anim@@ als, not just a farm that meas@@ u@@ res its success by the health of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s, but a farm that's literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ cation plant -- and not just for those fish@@ , but for you and me as well.    
 Because when that water lea@@ ves, it du@@ mp@@ s out into the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic.    
 A dro@@ p in the oce@@ an, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you, because this love story, ho@@ we@@ ver rom@@ an@@ tic@@ , is also in@@ struc@@ tive.    
 for the future of good food, whether we're talking about bas@@ s or be@@ ef c@@ att@@ le.    
 What we need now is a ra@@ dic@@ ally new concep@@ tion of ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture, one in which the food actually ta@@ st@@ es goo@@ d.    
     But for a lot people, that's a bit too ra@@ dic@@ al.    
 We're not real@@ ist@@ s, us foo@@ di@@ es@@ ; we're lo@@ ver@@ s.    
 We love far@@ mer@@ s' marke@@ ts, we love small family far@@ ms, we talk about local food, we e@@ at organ@@ ic.    
 And when you sugg@@ est these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food, some@@ one, some@@ where stan@@ ds up and says, "H@@ ey gu@@ y, I love p@@ ink fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, but how are you going to feed the world@@ ?"    
 How are you going to feed the worl@@ d?    
 Can I be hon@@ est@@ ?    
 I don't love that ques@@ tion.    
 No, not because we already produce enough cal@@ or@@ ies to more than feed the world.    
 One billion people will go hun@@ gr@@ y today.    
 One billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of g@@ ross ine@@ qu@@ ali@@ ties in di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion, not ton@@ n@@ age.    
 Now, I don't love this question because it's de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed the logi@@ c of our food system for the last 50 years.    
 F@@ e@@ ed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ v@@ ore@@ s, p@@ es@@ tic@@ id@@ es to mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures, chemic@@ als to so@@ il, ch@@ ic@@ ken to fish@@ , and all along ag@@ ri@@ business has simply as@@ ke@@ d, "@@ If we're fe@@ e@@ ding more people more chea@@ pl@@ y, how terri@@ ble could that be@@ ?"    
 That's been the motiv@@ ation, it's been the jus@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ tion@@ : it's been the business pl@@ an of American ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture.    
 We should call it what it is@@ : a business that's quick@@ ly er@@ o@@ ding ec@@ o@@ logical cap@@ ital that makes that very produc@@ tion possib@@ le.    
 That's not a busin@@ ess, and it isn't ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture.    
 Our b@@ read@@ bas@@ ket is thre@@ at@@ ened today, not because of di@@ min@@ ish@@ ing supp@@ ly, but because of di@@ min@@ ish@@ ing resour@@ c@@ es.    
 Not by the lat@@ est comb@@ ine and trac@@ tor inv@@ en@@ tion, but by fer@@ ti@@ le lan@@ d@@ ; not by pu@@ mp@@ s, but by f@@ res@@ h wat@@ er@@ ; not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ w@@ s, but by fore@@ st@@ s@@ ; and not by fish@@ ing bo@@ at@@ s and ne@@ ts, but by fish in the se@@ a.    
 W@@ ant to feed the worl@@ d?    
 Let's start by as@@ k@@ ing@@ : How are we going to feed our@@ selv@@ es?    
 Or bet@@ ter@@ : How can we create condi@@ tions that en@@ able every community to feed it@@ self@@ ?    
   To do that, don't look at the ag@@ ri@@ business model for the fu@@ ture.    
 It's really old, and it's ti@@ re@@ d.    
 It's high on cap@@ it@@ al, chem@@ i@@ str@@ y and mach@@ in@@ es, and it's never produc@@ ed anything really good to e@@ at.    
 Instea@@ d, let's look to the ec@@ o@@ logical model@@ .    
 That's the one that reli@@ es on two billion years of on-@@ the@@ -@@ job experienc@@ e.

 You know, I'm oka@@ y with that, because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be deli@@ ci@@ ous.    
 Thank you.    
 I grew up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of science fic@@ tion.    
 In high school, I took a bu@@ s to school an hour each way every day.    
 And I was always ab@@ sor@@ bed in a book, science fic@@ tion book, which took my mind to other worl@@ ds, and satis@@ fi@@ ed, in a nar@@ ra@@ tive for@@ m, this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of curi@@ os@@ ity that I ha@@ d.    
 And you know, that curi@@ os@@ ity also man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ ted itself in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever I wasn't in school I was out in the w@@ oo@@ ds, hi@@ king and taking "@@ sam@@ pl@@ es@@ " -- f@@ ro@@ g@@ s and s@@ na@@ kes and bu@@ g@@ s and p@@ ond water -- and br@@ ing@@ ing it back, looking at it under the micro@@ sc@@ op@@ e.    
 You know, I was a real science ge@@ e@@ k.    
 But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the lim@@ its of possib@@ ility.    
 And my love of science fic@@ tion actually seemed mir@@ ro@@ red in the world around me, because what was happen@@ ing, this was in the l@@ ate '@@ 6@@ 0@@ s, we were going to the mo@@ on, we were explor@@ ing the de@@ ep oce@@ an@@ s.    
 J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ stea@@ u was coming into our living room@@ s with his amazing speci@@ als that show@@ ed us anim@@ als and places and a won@@ d@@ rou@@ s world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ously imagin@@ ed.    
 So, that seemed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fic@@ tion part of it.    
 And I was an arti@@ st.    
 I could dra@@ w@@ . I could pain@@ t.    
 And I found that because there weren't video games and this s@@ atu@@ ra@@ tion of C@@ G movi@@ es and all of this imag@@ ery in the media lan@@ ds@@ cap@@ e, I had to create these images in my hea@@ d.    
 You know, we all di@@ d, as kids having to read a book, and through the au@@ th@@ or@@ 's descri@@ p@@ tion, put something on the movie scre@@ en in our head@@ s.    
 And so, my respon@@ se to this was to pain@@ t, to dra@@ w ali@@ en creatu@@ re@@ s, ali@@ en worl@@ ds, robo@@ ts, spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps, all that stuff@@ .    
 I was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in mat@@ h class do@@ o@@ d@@ ling behind the t@@ ex@@ t@@ boo@@ k.    
 That was -- the creativ@@ ity had to find its out@@ let some@@ h@@ ow@@ .    
 And an interesting thing happen@@ ed@@ : The J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ stea@@ u show@@ s actually got me very exc@@ ited about the fact that there was an ali@@ en world right here on Ear@@ th.    
 I might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.    
 But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Ear@@ th, that was as rich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that I had imagin@@ ed from reading these boo@@ ks.    
 So, I decided I was going to become a sc@@ u@@ b@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 1@@ 5@@ .    
 And the only problem with that was that I li@@ ved in a little v@@ il@@ la@@ ge in C@@ an@@ ada@@ , 6@@ 00 miles from the ne@@ are@@ st oce@@ an.    
 But I didn't let that da@@ un@@ t me.    
 I p@@ es@@ tered my father until he finally found a sc@@ u@@ b@@ a class in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Yor@@ k, right across the b@@ order from where we liv@@ e.    
 And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a po@@ o@@ l at a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in the de@@ ad of win@@ ter in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o, New Yor@@ k.    
 And I didn't see the oce@@ an, a real oce@@ an, for another two years, until we moved to Californi@@ a.    
 S@@ in@@ ce then, in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 40 years, I've spent about 3@@ ,000 hours under@@ wat@@ er, and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ es.    
 And I've learned that that deep@@ -@@ oce@@ an environ@@ ment, and even the sh@@ allow oce@@ an@@ s, are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagin@@ ation.    
 N@@ atu@@ re@@ 's imagin@@ ation is so boun@@ d@@ less comp@@ ared to our own me@@ ag@@ er human imagin@@ ation.    
 I sti@@ ll@@ , to this day, stand in absolu@@ te a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ v@@ es.    
 And my love aff@@ air with the oce@@ an is on@@ go@@ ing, and just as strong as it ever was@@ .    
 But when I ch@@ ose a care@@ er as an adul@@ t, it was fil@@ m@@ ma@@ king.    
 And that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge I had to tell stories with my ur@@ g@@ es to create imag@@ es.    
 And I was, as a kid@@ , con@@ stan@@ tly dra@@ w@@ ing com@@ ic boo@@ ks, and so on.    
 So, fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together, and that made sen@@ se.    
 And of course the stories that I ch@@ ose to tell were science fic@@ tion stor@@ i@@ es@@ : "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ ator@@ ," "A@@ li@@ en@@ s@@ " and "The A@@ by@@ s@@ s."    
 And with "The A@@ by@@ s@@ s@@ ," I was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ ma@@ king.    
 So, you know, mer@@ g@@ ing the two pas@@ sion@@ s.    
 Some@@ thing interesting came out of "The A@@ by@@ s@@ s@@ ," which was that to solve a speci@@ fic nar@@ ra@@ tive problem on that fil@@ m, which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water creatu@@ re, we actually em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated ani@@ ma@@ tion, C@@ G@@ .    
 And this resul@@ ted in the first so@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ sur@@ face charac@@ ter, C@@ G ani@@ ma@@ tion that was ever in a movi@@ e.    
 And even though the film didn't make any money -- b@@ are@@ ly bro@@ ke ev@@ en, I should say -- I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed something ama@@ z@@ ing, which is that the audi@@ ence, the global audi@@ ence, was mes@@ mer@@ ized by this app@@ aren@@ t mag@@ ic.    
 You know, it's Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ k@@ e's la@@ w that any su@@ ffic@@ i@@ ently adv@@ anc@@ ed technology is indi@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from mag@@ ic.    
 They were seeing something mag@@ ic@@ al.    
 And so that got me very exc@@ it@@ ed.    
 And I thought, "@@ W@@ ow, this is something that needs to be em@@ br@@ ac@@ ed into the c@@ ine@@ ma@@ tic ar@@ t@@ ."    
 So, with "@@ T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or 2@@ ," which was my next fil@@ m, we took that much far@@ ther@@ .    
 Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M@@ , we created the li@@ qu@@ id me@@ tal du@@ de in that fil@@ m. The success hun@@ g in the bal@@ ance on whether that effec@@ t would work.    
 And it di@@ d, and we created magic again, and we had the same result with an audi@@ ence -- al@@ though we did make a little more money on that one.    
 So, dra@@ w@@ ing a line through those two do@@ ts of experience came to, "@@ This is going to be a whole new world@@ ," this was a whole new world of creativ@@ ity for film arti@@ st@@ s.    
 So, I started a company with St@@ an W@@ in@@ st@@ on, my good friend St@@ an W@@ in@@ st@@ on, who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and creatu@@ re desig@@ ner at that time, and it was called D@@ ig@@ ital D@@ om@@ ain@@ .    
 And the concept of the company was the an@@ al@@ o@@ g process@@ es of op@@ tical p@@ r@@ inter@@ s and so on, and we would go right to digital produc@@ tion.    
 And we actually did that and it gave us a compe@@ ti@@ tive adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge for a whi@@ le.    
 But we found ourselves la@@ gg@@ ing in the mi@@ d '@@ 9@@ 0@@ s in the creatu@@ re and charac@@ ter design stuff that we had actually foun@@ ded the company to do.    
 So, I wrote this piece called "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," which was me@@ ant to absolutely pus@@ h the en@@ velop@@ e of vi@@ su@@ al effec@@ ts, of C@@ G effec@@ ts, bey@@ on@@ d, with real@@ istic human emo@@ tive charac@@ ters gener@@ ated in C@@ G@@ , and the main charac@@ ters would all be in C@@ G@@ , and the world would be in C@@ G@@ .    
 And the en@@ velop@@ e push@@ ed back, and I was told by the fol@@ ks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a whi@@ le.    
 So, I sh@@ el@@ ved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks.    
   You know, I went and p@@ it@@ ched it to the stu@@ di@@ o as "@@ '@@ R@@ ome@@ o and J@@ u@@ li@@ et@@ ' on a shi@@ p@@ : "@@ It's going to be this epic rom@@ anc@@ e, pas@@ sion@@ ate fil@@ m@@ ."    
 S@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ly, what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ."    
 And that's why I made the movi@@ e.    
   And that's the tru@@ th. Now, the stu@@ di@@ o didn't know that.    
 But I con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed them. I said, "@@ We're going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k. We're going to film it for real@@ .    
 We@@ 'll be using it in the op@@ ening of the fil@@ m.    
 It will be really import@@ ant. It will be a great marke@@ ting h@@ oo@@ k@@ ."    
 And I talked them into fund@@ ing an ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tion.    
   S@@ oun@@ ds craz@@ y. But this goes back to that the@@ me about your imagin@@ ation creating a real@@ ity.    
 Because we actually created a reality where six months later, I find myself in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ sible two and a half miles down in the nor@@ th A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic@@ , looking at the real T@@ it@@ an@@ ic through a view por@@ t.    
 Not a movi@@ e, not H@@ D -- for real@@ .    
   Now, that b@@ le@@ w my min@@ d.    
 And it took a lot of pre@@ par@@ ation, we had to build camer@@ as and li@@ ghts and all kinds of things.    
 But, it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ ve, these de@@ ep di@@ ves, was like a space mis@@ sion.    
 You know, where it was high@@ ly tech@@ n@@ ic@@ al, and it re@@ qui@@ red en@@ or@@ m@@ ous plan@@ n@@ ing.    
 You get in this cap@@ su@@ le, you go down to this dar@@ k h@@ os@@ ti@@ le environment where there is no hope of res@@ cu@@ e And I thought like, "@@ W@@ ow@@ . I'm like, living in a science fic@@ tion movi@@ e.    
 This is really co@@ ol@@ ."    
 And so, I really got b@@ it@@ ten by the bu@@ g of deep@@ -@@ oce@@ an explor@@ ation.    
 O@@ f course, the curi@@ os@@ ity, the science comp@@ on@@ ent of it -- it was every@@ thing. It was ad@@ ven@@ ture, it was curi@@ os@@ ity, it was imagin@@ ation.    
 And it was an experience that Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood couldn't give me.    
 Be@@ cause, you know, I could imagine a creatu@@ re and we could create a vi@@ su@@ al effec@@ t for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that win@@ dow@@ .    
 As we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions, I was seeing creatu@@ res at hy@@ dro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that I had never seen before@@ , sometimes things that no one had seen before@@ , that actually were not descri@@ bed by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them.    
 So, I was completely sm@@ it@@ ten by this, and had to do more.    
 And so, I actually made a kind of curi@@ ous deci@@ sion.    
 Af@@ ter the success of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ," I said, "O@@ K@@ , I'm going to par@@ k my day job as a Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood movie ma@@ k@@ er, and I'm going to go be a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time explo@@ re@@ r for a whi@@ le@@ ."    
 And so, we started plan@@ ning these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions.    
 And we w@@ ound up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k, and explor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ les.    
 We went back to the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic w@@ rec@@ k.    
 We took little bo@@ ts that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ b@@ er op@@ tic.    
 And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ v@@ ey of that shi@@ p, which had never been don@@ e.    
 No@@ body had ever looked inside the w@@ rec@@ k. They didn't have the means to do it, so we created technology to do it.    
 of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic, sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ sib@@ le, and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this, where I knew that the b@@ and had play@@ ed.    
 And I'm fl@@ ying a little robo@@ tic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the shi@@ p.    
 When I say, "I'm oper@@ ating it@@ ," but my mind is in the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le.    
 I felt like I was physic@@ ally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic.    
 And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u experience I've ever ha@@ d, because I would know before I turned a cor@@ ner of the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed it, because I had walked the set for months And the set was based as an ex@@ act re@@ p@@ lic@@ a on the bl@@ u@@ ep@@ rin@@ ts of the shi@@ p.    
 So, it was this absolutely re@@ mar@@ k@@ able experienc@@ e.    
 And it really made me realize that the tel@@ ep@@ res@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic a@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ s, then your consciousness is in@@ jec@@ ted into the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le, into this other form of exist@@ ence.    
 It was re@@ ally, really quite prof@@ oun@@ d.    
 And it may be a little bit of a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happen@@ ing some deca@@ des out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for explor@@ ation or for other means in many sort of po@@ st@@ -@@ human fu@@ tures that I can imagin@@ e, as a science fic@@ tion f@@ an.    
 So, having done these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions, and really beginning to app@@ reci@@ ate what was down there, such as at the de@@ ep oce@@ an v@@ ents where we had these ama@@ z@@ ing, amazing anim@@ als -- they're basically ali@@ en@@ s right here on Ear@@ th.    
 They live in an environment of chem@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ thes@@ is.    
 They don't survi@@ ve on sun@@ light@@ -@@ based system the way we do.    
 And so, you're seeing anim@@ als that are living next to a 5@@ 00@@ -@@ degre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ gra@@ de water pl@@ um@@ es.    
 You think they can't possib@@ ly exist@@ .    
 At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again, it's the science fic@@ tion in@@ flu@@ ence, as a kid@@ .    
 And I w@@ ound up getting invol@@ ved with the space commun@@ ity, really invol@@ ved with N@@ A@@ S@@ A@@ , sitting on the N@@ A@@ S@@ A adv@@ is@@ or@@ y bo@@ ar@@ d, plan@@ ning actu@@ al space mis@@ sion@@ s, going to R@@ us@@ si@@ a, going through the pre@@ -@@ c@@ os@@ mon@@ a@@ ut bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal pro@@ to@@ col@@ s, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and f@@ ly to the inter@@ national space st@@ ation with our 3@@ D camera system@@ s.    
 And this was fascin@@ at@@ ing.    
 But what I w@@ ound up doing was br@@ ing@@ ing space scientists with us into the deep@@ .    
 ast@@ ro@@ bio@@ logi@@ sts, plan@@ et@@ ary scienti@@ sts, people who were interested in these ex@@ tre@@ me environ@@ ments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents, and le@@ tting them see, and take sam@@ ples and test in@@ stru@@ ment@@ s, and so on.    
 So, here we were making do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary fil@@ ms, but actually doing sci@@ ence, and actually doing space sci@@ ence.    
 I'd completely clo@@ sed the loo@@ p between being the science fic@@ tion f@@ an, and doing this stuff for real@@ .    
 And you know, along the way in this jour@@ ney of discover@@ y, I learned a lo@@ t.    
 I learned a lot about sci@@ ence. But I also learned a lot about lead@@ er@@ shi@@ p.    
 Now you think direc@@ tor has got to be a lead@@ er, lead@@ er of, cap@@ tain of the shi@@ p, and all that sort of thing.    
 I didn't really learn about lead@@ er@@ ship until I did these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions.    
 Because I had to, at a certain poin@@ t, say, "What am I doing out her@@ e?    
 Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it@@ ?"    
 We don't make money at these d@@ am@@ n show@@ s.    
 We b@@ are@@ ly break ev@@ en. There is no f@@ ame in it.    
 People sort of think I went away between "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ " and "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ " and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my na@@ ils some@@ plac@@ e, sitting at the be@@ ach@@ .    
 M@@ ad@@ e all these fil@@ ms, made all these do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very lim@@ ited audi@@ ence.    
 No fam@@ e, no g@@ l@@ or@@ y, no mone@@ y. What are you do@@ ing?    
 You're doing it for the t@@ ask it@@ self, for the challenge -- and the oce@@ an is the most challeng@@ ing environment there is -- for the th@@ r@@ ill of discover@@ y, and for that str@@ ange b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ ght@@ ly k@@ n@@ it te@@ am.    
 Because we would do these things with 10@@ , 1@@ 2 people, working for years at a time, sometimes at se@@ a for tw@@ o, three months at a time.    
 And in that bon@@ d, you realize that the most important thing is the res@@ pect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a t@@ ask that you can't explain to someone el@@ se.    
 When you come back to the shor@@ e and you say, "@@ We had to do this, and the fi@@ b@@ er op@@ tic@@ , and the att@@ en@@ tu@@ ation, and the this and the that, all the technology of it, and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty, the human@@ -@@ perfor@@ man@@ ce as@@ pec@@ ts of working at se@@ a@@ ," you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe cop@@ s ha@@ ve, or people in comb@@ at that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it.    
 C@@ re@@ ates a bon@@ d, cre@@ ates a b@@ ond of res@@ pec@@ t.    
 So, when I came back to make my next movi@@ e, which was "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," I tried to app@@ ly that same prin@@ ci@@ ple of lead@@ er@@ shi@@ p, which is that you res@@ pect your te@@ am, and you ear@@ n their res@@ pect in re@@ tur@@ n.    
 And it really changed the dy@@ nam@@ ic.    
 So, here I was again with a small te@@ am, in un@@ char@@ ted ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y, doing "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," coming up with new technology that didn't ex@@ ist before.    
 T@@ re@@ m@@ end@@ ously exc@@ it@@ ing.    
 T@@ re@@ m@@ end@@ ously challeng@@ ing.    
 And we became a family, over a four@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ half year peri@@ o@@ d.    
 And it completely changed how I do movi@@ es.    
 So, people have com@@ mented on h@@ ow, "Well, you know, you brought back the oce@@ an organ@@ is@@ ms and put them on the plan@@ et of P@@ an@@ d@@ or@@ a@@ ."    
 To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing busin@@ ess, the process it@@ self, that changed as a result of that.    
 So, what can we syn@@ thes@@ ize out of all this?    
 You know, what are the less@@ ons lear@@ ne@@ d?    
 Well, I think number one is curi@@ os@@ ity.    
 It's the most powerful thing you ow@@ n.    
 I@@ mag@@ in@@ ation is a for@@ ce that can actually man@@ i@@ f@@ est a real@@ ity.    
 And the res@@ pect of your team is more important than all the la@@ u@@ rel@@ s in the world.    
 I have young fil@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ers come up to me and say, "@@ G@@ i@@ ve me some adv@@ ice for doing this@@ ."    
 And I say, "D@@ on@@ 't put lim@@ it@@ ations on your@@ self.    
 O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don't do it to your@@ self, don't be@@ t against your@@ self, and take risk@@ s."    
 N@@ A@@ S@@ A has this ph@@ r@@ ase that they like@@ : "@@ F@@ a@@ il@@ ure is not an op@@ tion@@ ."    
 But fail@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in art and in explor@@ ation, because it's a lea@@ p of fa@@ i@@ th.    
 And no important en@@ dea@@ v@@ or that re@@ qui@@ red inno@@ v@@ ation was done without ris@@ k.    
 You have to be willing to take those risk@@ s.    
 So, that's the thought I would leave you with@@ , is that in what@@ ever you're do@@ ing, fail@@ ure is an op@@ tion, but fe@@ ar is no@@ t. Thank you.    
 If I can leave you with one big idea today, it's that the whole of the data in which we con@@ su@@ me is great@@ er that the su@@ m of the par@@ ts, and instead of thinking about information over@@ lo@@ a@@ d, we can use information so that patter@@ ns po@@ p and we can see t@@ ren@@ ds that would other@@ w@@ ise be in@@ vi@@ sib@@ le.    
 So what we're looking at right here is a typical mor@@ tal@@ ity char@@ t organ@@ ized by age.    
 This tool that I'm using here is a little experi@@ ment.    
 It's called P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, and with P@@ i@@ vo@@ t what I can do is I can choose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of dea@@ th@@ s -- say, acc@@ id@@ ents.    
 And, right away, I see there's a different patter@@ n that emerg@@ es.    
 This is be@@ cause, in the m@@ id@@ -@@ area here, people are at their most ac@@ tive, and over here they're at their most fra@@ il.    
 We can step back out again and then re@@ organ@@ ize the data by cause of dea@@ th, seeing that cir@@ cul@@ ator@@ y diseas@@ es and can@@ c@@ er are the usu@@ al s@@ us@@ pec@@ ts, but not for every@@ one.    
 If we go a@@ head and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that acc@@ id@@ ents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be wor@@ ried ab@@ out.    
 And if you d@@ r@@ ill into that, it's especially the case for m@@ en.    
 So you get the idea that view@@ ing informa@@ tion, view@@ ing data in this way, is a lot like s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing in a living information in@@ f@@ o@@ -@@ graph@@ ic.    
 And if we can do this for ra@@ w dat@@ a, why not do it for cont@@ ent as well@@ ?    
 So what we have right here is the co@@ ver of every single S@@ por@@ ts I@@ ll@@ u@@ str@@ ated ever produc@@ ed.    
 It's all her@@ e@@ ; it's all on the we@@ b@@ .    
 You can go back to your room@@ s and try this after my tal@@ k.    
 With P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, you can d@@ r@@ ill into a deca@@ de.    
 You can d@@ r@@ ill into a particular year.    
 You can ju@@ m@@ p right into a speci@@ fic issu@@ e.    
 So I'm looking at this@@ ; I see the a@@ th@@ let@@ es that have appe@@ ared in this issu@@ e, the sp@@ ort@@ s.    
 I'm a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ strong f@@ an, so I'll go a@@ head and I'll c@@ lic@@ k on that, which re@@ ve@@ als, for me, all the issu@@ es in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong@@ 's been a part of.    
   Now, if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ e@@ k at thes@@ e, "Well, what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing@@ ?"    
 So I can step back, and exp@@ and on that.    
 And I see Gre@@ g Le@@ M@@ ond now.    
 And so you get the idea that when you na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate over information this way -- going nar@@ row@@ er, bro@@ ad@@ er, bac@@ king in, bac@@ king out -- you're not se@@ arch@@ ing, you're not b@@ row@@ s@@ ing.    
 You're doing something that's actually a little bit differ@@ ent.    
 It's in betwe@@ en, and we think it changes the way information can be us@@ ed.    
 So I want to extra@@ pol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit craz@@ y.    
 What we're done here is we've taken every single Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ age and we re@@ duc@@ ed it down to a little sum@@ mar@@ y.    
 So the sum@@ mar@@ y con@@ si@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indi@@ c@@ ate the top@@ ical area that it comes from@@ .    
 I'm only showing the top 500 most pop@@ ular Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ ages right here.    
 But even in this lim@@ ited view@@ , we can do a lot of things.    
 Ri@@ ght away, we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ ain@@ s that are most pop@@ ular on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a.    
 I'm going to go a@@ head and sel@@ ec@@ t govern@@ ment.    
 Now, having sel@@ ec@@ ted govern@@ ment, I can now see that the Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a categor@@ ies that most fre@@ qu@@ ently cor@@ respon@@ d to that are T@@ i@@ me mag@@ az@@ ine People of the Y@@ ear@@ .    
 So this is really important because this is an in@@ si@@ ght that was not con@@ tain@@ ed within any one Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ age.    
 It's only possible to see that in@@ si@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them.    
 L@@ oo@@ king at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies, I can then d@@ r@@ ill into the concept of T@@ i@@ me mag@@ az@@ ine P@@ er@@ son of the Y@@ ear@@ , br@@ ing@@ ing up all of them.    
 So looking at these people, I can see that the maj@@ or@@ ity come from govern@@ ment@@ ; some have come from natural sci@@ enc@@ es@@ ; som@@ e, fe@@ w@@ er sti@@ ll@@ , have come from business -- there's my b@@ os@@ s -- and one has come from mus@@ ic.    
 And interes@@ t@@ ingly enou@@ gh, B@@ on@@ o is also a TED P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ n@@ er.    
 So we can go@@ , ju@@ mp@@ , and take a look at all the TED P@@ ri@@ ze win@@ n@@ ers.    
 So you see, we're na@@ vi@@ g@@ ating the we@@ b for the first time as if it's actually a we@@ b@@ , not from pa@@ ge@@ -@@ to-@@ p@@ age, but at a high@@ er level of ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion.    
 And so I want to show you one other thing that may cat@@ ch you a little bit by surpri@@ se.    
 I'm just showing the New York T@@ im@@ es we@@ b@@ s@@ ite here.    
 So P@@ i@@ vo@@ t, this appli@@ cation -- I don't want to call it a b@@ row@@ ser@@ ; it's really not a b@@ row@@ s@@ er, but you can view we@@ b p@@ ages with it -- and we bring that z@@ o@@ om@@ able technology to every single we@@ b p@@ age like this.    
 So I can step back, po@@ p right back into a speci@@ fic se@@ c@@ tion.    
 Now the reason why this is important is be@@ cause, by virtu@@ e of just view@@ ing we@@ b p@@ ages in this way, I can look at my entire b@@ row@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way.    
 So I can d@@ r@@ ill into what I've done over speci@@ fic time f@@ r@@ am@@ es.    
 H@@ er@@ e, in fact, is the state of all the de@@ m@@ o that I just ga@@ ve.    
 And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at earli@@ er today.    
 And, if I want to step back and look at every@@ thing, I can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my hi@@ story, perhaps by my se@@ arch history -- here, I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ sti@@ c se@@ arch@@ ing, looking for B@@ ing, over here for Li@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ i@@ vo@@ t.    
 And from thes@@ e, I can d@@ r@@ ill into the we@@ b p@@ age and just la@@ unch them again.    
 It's one me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ed multi@@ ple times, and in each case it makes the whole great@@ er than the su@@ m of the par@@ ts with the dat@@ a.    
 So right now, in this world, we think about data as being this cur@@ se.    
 We talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ lo@@ a@@ d.    
 We talk about d@@ row@@ ning in dat@@ a.    
 What if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the we@@ b up@@ side dow@@ n, so that instead of na@@ vi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the nex@@ t, we get used to the ha@@ bit of being able to go from many things to many things, and then being able to see the patter@@ ns that were other@@ w@@ ise h@@ idd@@ en@@ ?    
 If we can do that, then instead of being tra@@ pped in dat@@ a, we might actually ex@@ tr@@ act information.    
 And, instead of de@@ al@@ ing just with informa@@ tion, we can te@@ ase out knowle@@ dg@@ e.    
 And if we get the knowle@@ dg@@ e, then maybe even there's wis@@ dom to be foun@@ d.    
 So with that, I th@@ ank you.    
 Every@@ body tal@@ ks about happiness these day@@ s.    
 with "@@ happin@@ ess@@ " in the ti@@ tle publi@@ sh@@ ed in the last five years and they gave up after about 4@@ 0, and there were many more.    
 There is a huge wa@@ ve of inter@@ est in happin@@ ess, am@@ ong rese@@ arch@@ ers.    
 There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing.    
 Every@@ body would like to make people happ@@ i@@ er.    
 But in sp@@ ite of all this f@@ loo@@ d of work, there are several cog@@ ni@@ tive tra@@ ps that sort of make it almost impos@@ sible to think stra@@ ight about happin@@ ess.    
 And my talk today will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these cog@@ ni@@ tive tra@@ p@@ s.    
 This appli@@ es to lay@@ people thinking about their own happin@@ ess, and it appli@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happin@@ ess, because it turns out we're just as m@@ ess@@ ed up as anybody else is.    
 The first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to adm@@ it comple@@ x@@ ity.    
 It turns out that the word "@@ happin@@ ess@@ " is just not a us@@ e@@ ful word any@@ mo@@ re, because we app@@ ly it to too many different things.    
 I think there is one particular mean@@ ing to which we might re@@ stri@@ ct it, but by and larg@@ e, this is something that we@@ 'll have to give up and we@@ 'll have to ad@@ op@@ t the more complicated view of what well@@ -@@ being is.    
 The second tra@@ p is a conf@@ usi@@ on between experience and memor@@ y@@ ; bas@@ ic@@ ally, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life.    
 And those are two very different concep@@ ts, and they're both lu@@ mp@@ ed in the no@@ tion of happin@@ ess.    
 And the third is the foc@@ using ill@@ usi@@ on, and it's the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can't think about any cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ce that affec@@ ts well@@ -@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its import@@ anc@@ e.    
 I mean, this is a real cog@@ ni@@ tive tra@@ p.    
 There's just no way of getting it right.    
 Now, I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ answer ses@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tures repor@@ ted a story, and that was a story -- He said he@@ 'd been list@@ ening to a sy@@ mp@@ hon@@ y, and it was absolutely g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the rec@@ ord@@ ing, there was a d@@ read@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching soun@@ d.    
 And then he ad@@ ded, really quite emo@@ tion@@ ally, it ru@@ ined the whole experienc@@ e.    
 But it ha@@ d@@ n'@@ t.    
 What it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experienc@@ e.    
 He had had the experienc@@ e.    
 He had had 20 minut@@ es of g@@ l@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic.    
 They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memor@@ y@@ ; the memory was ru@@ in@@ ed, and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep@@ .    
 What this is telling us, re@@ ally, is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves.    
 There is an experiencing self, who lives in the present and knows the pres@@ ent, is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ living the pa@@ st, but basically it has only the pres@@ ent.    
 It's the experiencing self that the doctor approach@@ es -- you know, when the doctor as@@ ks, "D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I tou@@ ch you her@@ e@@ ?"    
 And then there is a remembering self, and the remembering self is the one that keep@@ s s@@ co@@ re, and main@@ tain@@ s the story of our life, and it's the one that the doctor approach@@ es in asking the ques@@ tion, "@@ How have you been feeling lat@@ el@@ y@@ ?"    
 or "@@ How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ b@@ ani@@ a@@ ?" or something like that.    
 Th@@ ose are two very different enti@@ ties, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the no@@ tion of happin@@ ess.    
 Now, the remembering self is a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ l@@ er.    
 And that really starts with a basic respon@@ se of our memor@@ ies -- it starts im@@ medi@@ at@@ el@@ y.    
 We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stor@@ ies.    
 Our memory tel@@ ls us stor@@ ies, that is, what we get to keep from our experienc@@ es is a story.    
 And let me begin with one examp@@ le.    
 This is an old stud@@ y.    
 Th@@ ose are actu@@ al pati@@ ents under@@ going a pain@@ ful proc@@ edu@@ re.    
 I won@@ 't go into deta@@ il. It's no longer pain@@ ful these days, but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s.    
 They were asked to repor@@ t on their pa@@ in every 6@@ 0 secon@@ ds.    
 Here are two pati@@ ents, those are their rec@@ ord@@ ings.    
 And you are as@@ ke@@ d, "@@ Who of them suffer@@ ed mo@@ re@@ ?"    
 And it's a very easy ques@@ tion.    
 C@@ lear@@ ly, P@@ ati@@ ent B suffer@@ ed more -- his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was long@@ er, and every min@@ u@@ te of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A ha@@ d, P@@ ati@@ ent B ha@@ d, and more.    
 But now there is another ques@@ tion@@ : "@@ How much did these pati@@ ents think they suffer@@ ed@@ ?"    
 And here is a surpri@@ se.    
 The surpri@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much worse memory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .    
 The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies were differ@@ ent, and because a very cri@@ tical part of the story is how it end@@ s.    
 And nei@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ spir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dist@@ in@@ ct ... but one of them is dist@@ inc@@ tly worse than the other.    
 And the one that is worse is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ a@@ k at the very end@@ ; it's a bad story.    
 How do we know that?    
 Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y, and much later, to@@ o, "@@ How bad was the whole thing, in to@@ tal@@ ?"    
 And it was much worse for A than for B@@ , in memor@@ y.    
 Now this is a direc@@ t conf@@ li@@ ct between the experiencing self and the remembering self.    
 F@@ rom the point of view of the experiencing self, c@@ lear@@ ly, B had a worse time.    
 Now, what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A@@ , and we actually r@@ an cl@@ ini@@ cal experi@@ ment@@ s, and it has been don@@ e, and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ t@@ end the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just keep@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much.    
 That will cause the pati@@ ent to suffer@@ , but just a little and much less than before.    
 And if you do that for a couple of minut@@ es, you have made the experiencing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A worse off@@ , and you have the remembering self of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off@@ , because now you have en@@ dow@@ ed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better story about his experienc@@ e.    
 What defin@@ es a stor@@ y?    
 And that is tru@@ e of the stories that memory deli@@ ver@@ s for us, and it's also tru@@ e of the stories that we make up.    
 What defin@@ es a story are chang@@ es, signific@@ ant moments and end@@ ings.    
 En@@ d@@ ings are very, very important and, in this case, the ending dom@@ in@@ ated.    
 Now, the experiencing self lives its life contin@@ u@@ ous@@ ly.    
 It has moments of experienc@@ e, one after the other.    
 And you can as@@ k@@ : What happens to these mom@@ ent@@ s?    
 And the answer is really stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ war@@ d@@ : They are lo@@ st fore@@ ver.    
 I mean, most of the moments of our life -- and I cal@@ cul@@ ated, you know, the psycho@@ logical present is said to be about three secon@@ ds long@@ ; that means that, you know, in a life there are about 6@@ 00 million of them@@ ; in a mon@@ th, there are about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 -- most of them don't leave a trac@@ e.    
 M@@ ost of them are completely ig@@ no@@ red by the remembering self.    
 And ye@@ t, some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t, that what happens during these moments of experience is our life.    
 It's the fin@@ ite resour@@ ce that we're sp@@ ending while we're on this ear@@ th.    
 And how to spend it would seem to be rele@@ v@@ ant, but that is not the story that the remembering self keep@@ s for us.    
 So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self, and they're really quite dist@@ inc@@ t.    
 The biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time.    
 F@@ rom the point of view of the experiencing self, if you have a va@@ cation, and the second week is just as good as the fir@@ st, then the tw@@ o@@ -@@ week va@@ cation is tw@@ ice as good as the one@@ -@@ week va@@ ca@@ tion.    
 That's not the way it wor@@ ks at all for the remembering self.    
 For the remembering self, a tw@@ o@@ -@@ week va@@ cation is b@@ are@@ ly better than the one@@ -@@ week va@@ cation because there are no new memor@@ ies ad@@ de@@ d.    
 You have not changed the story.    
 And in this way, time is actually the cri@@ tical vari@@ able that dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish@@ es a remembering self from an experiencing self@@ ; time has very little impact on the story.    
 Now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stor@@ ies.    
 It is actually the one that makes decisions be@@ cause, if you have a pati@@ ent who has ha@@ d, say, two col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is dec@@ id@@ ing which of them to choos@@ e, then the one that choos@@ es is the one that has the memory that is less ba@@ d, and that's the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ os@@ en.    
 The experiencing self has no vo@@ ice in this choic@@ e.    
 We actually don't choose between experienc@@ es, we choose between memor@@ ies of experienc@@ es.    
 And even when we think about the fu@@ ture, we don't think of our future nor@@ m@@ ally as experienc@@ es.    
 We think of our future as an@@ tici@@ p@@ ated memor@@ ies.    
 And basically you can look at this, you know, as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the remembering self, and you can think of the remembering self sort of dra@@ gg@@ ing the experiencing self through experienc@@ es that the experiencing self doesn't ne@@ ed.    
 I have that sense that when we go on va@@ cations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ently the ca@@ se@@ ; that is, we go on va@@ ca@@ tions, in the ser@@ vice of our remembering self.    
 And this is a bit hard to jus@@ ti@@ fy I thin@@ k.    
 I mean, how much do we con@@ su@@ me our memor@@ i@@ es?    
 That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is given for the dom@@ in@@ ance of the remembering self.    
 And when I think about that, I think about a va@@ cation we had in An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a a few years ago, which was c@@ lear@@ ly the best va@@ cation I've ever ha@@ d, and I think of it rela@@ tively of@@ t@@ en, rela@@ tive to how much I think of other va@@ ca@@ tions.    
 And I probably have con@@ sum@@ ed my memor@@ ies of that th@@ ree@@ -@@ week tri@@ p, I would say, for about 2@@ 5 minut@@ es in the last four years.    
 with the 6@@ 00 pictures in it, I would have spent another hour@@ .    
 Now, that is three wee@@ ks, and that is at most an hour and a hal@@ f@@ .    
 There seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ p@@ anc@@ y.    
 Now, I may be a bit ex@@ tre@@ me, you know, in how little appe@@ ti@@ te I have for con@@ sum@@ ing memor@@ ies, there is a gen@@ u@@ ine ques@@ tion@@ : Why do we put so much we@@ ight on memory rela@@ tive to the we@@ ight that we put on experienc@@ es?    
 So I want you to think about a thought experi@@ ment.    
 I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next va@@ cation, you know that at the end of the va@@ cation all your pictures will be des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed, and you'll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic d@@ ru@@ g so that you won@@ 't remember any@@ thing.    
 Now, would you choose the same va@@ ca@@ tion@@ ? And if you would choose a different va@@ cation, there is a conf@@ li@@ ct between your two selv@@ es, and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conf@@ lic@@ t, and it's actually not at all obvi@@ ous, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answ@@ er, and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies, you might get another answ@@ er.    
 Why do we pick the va@@ cations we do is a problem that conf@@ ron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves.    
 Now, the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happin@@ ess.    
 There are really two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can app@@ ly, one per self.    
 So you can as@@ k@@ : How happy is the experiencing self@@ ?    
 And then you would as@@ k@@ : How happy are the moments in the experiencing self@@ 's life@@ ?    
 And they're all -- happiness for moments is a fa@@ ir@@ ly complicated proc@@ ess.    
 What are the emo@@ tions that can be meas@@ u@@ re@@ d?    
 of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.    
 If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self, it's a completely different thing.    
 This is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives.    
 It is about how satis@@ fied or ple@@ as@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life.    
 V@@ ery different no@@ tion.    
 An@@ y@@ one who doesn't dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happin@@ ess, and I bel@@ ong to a c@@ row@@ d of students of well@@ -@@ be@@ ing, who@@ 've been m@@ ess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in pre@@ ci@@ sel@@ y this way.    
 happiness of the experiencing self and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the remembering self has been recog@@ n@@ ized in recent years, and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to measure the two se@@ par@@ at@@ el@@ y.    
 The G@@ all@@ up O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ation has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experienc@@ es, and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts along those lin@@ es.    
 So in recent years, we have be@@ gu@@ n to learn about the happiness of the two selves.    
 And the main less@@ on I think that we have learned is they are really differ@@ ent.    
 You can know how satis@@ fied somebody is with their life, and that really doesn't teach you much about how happ@@ ily they're living their life, and vice ver@@ sa@@ .    
 Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rela@@ tion, the cor@@ rela@@ tion is about .@@ 5@@ .    
 What that means is if you met some@@ bod@@ y, and you were t@@ old, "O@@ h his father is six fe@@ et t@@ all@@ ," how much would you know about his he@@ i@@ ght?    
 Well, you would know something about his he@@ i@@ ght, but there's a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty.    
 You have that much un@@ certain@@ ty.    
 If I tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of t@@ en, you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experiencing self.    
 So the cor@@ rela@@ tion is low@@ .    
 We know something about what contro@@ ls satis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self.    
 We know that money is very import@@ ant, go@@ als are very import@@ ant.    
 We know that happiness is main@@ ly being satis@@ fied with people that we like, sp@@ ending time with people that we lik@@ e.    
 There are other ple@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ s, but this is dom@@ in@@ ant.    
 So if you want to maxim@@ ize the happiness of the two selv@@ es, doing very different things.    
 The bo@@ t@@ to@@ m line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stitu@@ te for well@@ -@@ be@@ ing.    
 It is a completely different no@@ tion.    
 Now, very quick@@ ly, another reason we cannot think stra@@ ight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life, and we actually liv@@ e.    
 So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in Californi@@ a, you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answ@@ er.    
 When you ask that ques@@ tion, you think people must be happ@@ i@@ er in Californi@@ a i@@ f@@ , say, you live in O@@ hi@@ o.    
   And what happens is when you think about living in Californi@@ a, between Californi@@ a and other plac@@ es, and that con@@ tra@@ st, say, is in cli@@ mat@@ e.    
 Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the ref@@ lec@@ tive self But now, because the ref@@ lec@@ tive self is in char@@ g@@ e, you may end up -- some people may end up moving to Californi@@ a.    
 And it's sort of interesting to tr@@ ace what is going to happen to people who move to Californi@@ a in the hope of getting happ@@ i@@ er.    
 Well, their experiencing self is not going to get happ@@ i@@ er.    
 We know that.    
 But one thing will happen@@ : They will think they are happ@@ i@@ er, be@@ cause, when they think about it, they@@ 'll be re@@ min@@ ded of how hor@@ ri@@ ble the wea@@ ther was in O@@ hi@@ o, and they will feel they made the right deci@@ sion.    
 It is very difficult to think stra@@ ight about well@@ -@@ be@@ ing, and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is.    
 Thank you.    
   Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : Thank you. I've got a question for you.    
 Thank you so much.    
 Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago, you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y.    
 Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now@@ ?    
 D@@ ani@@ el K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man@@ : Su@@ re.    
 I think the most interesting result that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey is a numb@@ er, which we absolutely did not ex@@ pect to fin@@ d.    
 We found that with res@@ pect to the happiness of the experiencing self.    
 When we looked at how feel@@ ings, v@@ ary with in@@ com@@ e.    
 And it turns out that, bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars a year, for Americ@@ ans -- and that's a very large sam@@ ple of Americ@@ an@@ s, like 6@@ 00@@ ,00@@ 0, so it's a large represent@@ ative sam@@ ple -- bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 dollars a year@@ ...    
 CA: 6@@ 0@@ ,00@@ 0@@ .    
 D@@ K@@ : 6@@ 0@@ ,00@@ 0@@ .    
   6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars a year, people are un@@ happ@@ y, and they get progres@@ si@@ vel@@ y un@@ happ@@ i@@ er the po@@ ore@@ r they ge@@ t.    
 A@@ bo@@ ve that, we get an absolutely fl@@ at lin@@ e.    
 I mean I've ra@@ rely seen lin@@ es so f@@ lat@@ .    
 C@@ lear@@ ly, what is happen@@ ing is money does not buy you experi@@ ential happin@@ ess, but l@@ ack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ er@@ y, and we can measure that mis@@ ery very, very c@@ lear@@ ly.    
 In terms of the other self, the remembering self, you get a different story.    
 The more money you ear@@ n, the more satis@@ fied you are.    
 That does not hold for emo@@ tions.    
 CA: But D@@ an@@ n@@ y, the whole American en@@ dea@@ v@@ or is about life, li@@ ber@@ ty, the pur@@ su@@ it of happin@@ ess.    
 If people took seri@@ ously that fin@@ d@@ ing, I mean, it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe ab@@ out, like for example, ta@@ x@@ ation polic@@ y and so for@@ th.    
 Is there any chance that poli@@ tici@@ an@@ s, that the country gener@@ ally, would take a fin@@ ding like that seri@@ ously and run public polic@@ y based on it?    
 D@@ K@@ : You know I think that there is recog@@ ni@@ tion of the ro@@ le of happiness research in public polic@@ y.    
 The recog@@ ni@@ tion is going to be s@@ low in the United St@@ ates, no question about that, but in the U.@@ K@@ .@@ , it is happen@@ ing, People are recog@@ n@@ izing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public polic@@ y.    
 It's going to take a whi@@ le, and people are going to de@@ b@@ ate whether they want to study experience happin@@ ess, or whether they want to study life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation, so we need to have that de@@ b@@ ate fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on.    
 How to en@@ han@@ ce happiness goes very different ways dep@@ ending on how you think, and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self.    
 This is going to in@@ flu@@ ence polic@@ y, I think, in years to com@@ e.    
 In the United St@@ ates, eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the popula@@ tion.    
 This is going to be, I think, within the next deca@@ de or tw@@ o, part of national sta@@ tis@@ tic@@ s.    
 CA: Well, it seems to me that this issu@@ e will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting polic@@ y disc@@ us@@ sion to tr@@ ack over the next few years.    
 Thank you so much for invent@@ ing behavi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ic@@ s.    
 Thank you, D@@ an@@ ny K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man@@ .    
 I'm going to talk today about energy and cli@@ mat@@ e.    
 And that might seem a bit surpri@@ sing because my ful@@ l@@ -@@ time work at the F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion is mo@@ st@@ ly about vacc@@ ines and se@@ ed@@ s, to help the po@@ ore@@ st two billion live better lives.    
 But energy and climate are ex@@ trem@@ ely important to these people -- in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.    
 The climate getting worse means that many years, their c@@ ro@@ ps won@@ 't grow@@ : There will be too much ra@@ in, not enough ra@@ in, that their fra@@ gi@@ le environment simply can't supp@@ or@@ t.    
 And that lead@@ s to star@@ va@@ tion, it lead@@ s to un@@ certain@@ ty, it lead@@ s to un@@ re@@ st.    
 So, the climate changes will be terri@@ ble for them.    
 Al@@ so, the pri@@ ce of energy is very important to them.    
 In fact, if you could pick just one thing to low@@ er the pri@@ ce of, to re@@ duce po@@ ver@@ ty, by far you would pick energ@@ y.    
 Now, the pri@@ ce of energy has come down over time.    
 Re@@ ally adv@@ anc@@ ed ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation is based on adv@@ anc@@ es in energ@@ y.    
 The coal re@@ volu@@ tion fuel@@ ed the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evolu@@ tion, and, even in the 19@@ 00@@ s we've seen a very ra@@ pi@@ d de@@ cl@@ ine in the pri@@ ce of elec@@ tric@@ ity, and that's why we have re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ ator@@ s, air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing, we can make moder@@ n materi@@ als and do so many things.    
 And so, we're in a wonder@@ ful situation with elec@@ tri@@ city in the rich world.    
 But, as we make it chea@@ per -- and let's go for making it tw@@ ice as chea@@ p -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ in@@ t, and that con@@ stra@@ in@@ t has to do with CO@@ 2@@ .    
 CO2 is war@@ m@@ ing the plane@@ t, and the equ@@ ation on CO2 is actually a very stra@@ i@@ ght@@ forward one.    
 If you su@@ m up the CO2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted, that lead@@ s to a te@@ m@@ per@@ atu@@ re increas@@ e, and that te@@ m@@ per@@ atu@@ re increase lead@@ s to some very nega@@ tive effec@@ t@@ s: the effec@@ ts on the wea@@ ther@@ ; perhaps wor@@ se, the indi@@ rec@@ t effec@@ ts, in that the natural ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem@@ s can't ad@@ just to these ra@@ pi@@ d chang@@ es, and so you get ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem col@@ la@@ p@@ s@@ es.    
 Now, the ex@@ act amount of how you ma@@ p from a certain increase of CO2 to what te@@ m@@ per@@ atu@@ re will be and where the posi@@ tive fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks are, there's some un@@ certain@@ ty there, but not very much.    
 And there's certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effec@@ ts will be, but they will be ex@@ trem@@ ely ba@@ d.    
 I asked the top scientists on this several tim@@ es@@ : Do we really have to get down to near zer@@ o@@ ?    
 C@@ an@@ 't we just c@@ ut it in half or a quar@@ ter@@ ?    
 And the answer is that until we get near to zer@@ o, the te@@ m@@ per@@ atu@@ re will contin@@ ue to ri@@ se.    
 And so that's a big challeng@@ e.    
 It's very different than sa@@ ying "@@ We're a tw@@ el@@ ve@@ -@@ foo@@ t@@ -@@ high truc@@ k trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foo@@ t bri@@ dg@@ e, and we can just sort of squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze under@@ ."    
 This is something that has to get to zer@@ o.    
 Now, we put out a lot of car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ ide every year, over 2@@ 6 billion ton@@ s.    
 For each Americ@@ an, it's about 20 ton@@ s@@ ; for people in po@@ or countri@@ es, it's less than one t@@ on.    
 It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.    
 And, some@@ h@@ ow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zer@@ o.    
 It's been con@@ stan@@ tly going up.    
 It's only vari@@ ous econom@@ ic changes that have even fl@@ att@@ ened it at all, so we have to go from ra@@ p@@ id@@ ly ri@@ sing to f@@ all@@ ing, and f@@ all@@ ing all the way to zer@@ o.    
 This equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tor@@ s, a little bit of multi@@ p@@ li@@ ca@@ tion@@ : So, you've got a thing on the lef@@ t, CO@@ 2@@ , that you want to get to zer@@ o, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person@@ 's using on aver@@ age, the energy on average for each servic@@ e, and the CO2 being put out per un@@ it of energ@@ y.    
 So, let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zer@@ o.    
 P@@ rob@@ ab@@ ly, one of these numb@@ ers is going to have to get pretty near to zer@@ o.    
 Now that's back from high school al@@ ge@@ bra@@ , but let's take a loo@@ k.    
 Fir@@ st, we've got popula@@ tion.    
 The world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people.    
 That's head@@ ed up to about nine billi@@ on.    
 Now, if we do a really great job on new vacc@@ in@@ es, health ca@@ re, re@@ produc@@ tive health servic@@ es, we could low@@ er that b@@ y, perha@@ ps, 10 or 15 perc@@ ent, but there we see an increase of about 1@@ .@@ 3@@ .    
 The second fac@@ tor is the services we us@@ e.    
 This en@@ comp@@ as@@ ses every@@ thing@@ : the food we e@@ at, clo@@ thing, T@@ V@@ , he@@ at@@ ing.    
 These are very good thing@@ s: getting ri@@ d of po@@ ver@@ ty means provid@@ ing these services to almost everyone on the planet.    
 And it's a great thing for this number to go up.    
 In the rich world, perhaps the top one billi@@ on, we probably could c@@ ut back and use l@@ ess, but every year, this numb@@ er, on aver@@ age, is going to go up, and so, over all, that will more than d@@ ou@@ ble the services deli@@ ver@@ ed per pers@@ on.    
 Here we have a very basic servic@@ e: Do you have li@@ gh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work@@ ?    
 And, in fact, these kids don@@ '@@ t, so they're going out and reading their school work under the stre@@ et l@@ am@@ p@@ s.    
 Now, eff@@ ici@@ enc@@ y, E@@ , the energy for each servic@@ e, here finally we have some good new@@ s.    
 We have something that's not going up.    
 Th@@ rou@@ gh vari@@ ous inv@@ en@@ tions and new ways of doing light@@ ing, through different types of car@@ s, different ways of building build@@ ings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that ser@@ vice down quite sub@@ stan@@ ti@@ ally.    
 Some individual services even bring it down by 9@@ 0 perc@@ ent.    
 There are other services like how we make fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ er, or how we do air transp@@ or@@ t, where the room@@ s for impro@@ v@@ ement are far@@ , far l@@ ess.    
 And so, over@@ all here, if we're op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic@@ , we may get a re@@ duc@@ tion of a fac@@ tor of three to ev@@ en, perha@@ ps, a fac@@ tor of si@@ x@@ .    
 But for these first three fac@@ tors now, we've gone from 2@@ 6 billion to, at b@@ es@@ t, maybe 1@@ 3 billion ton@@ s, and that just won@@ 't c@@ ut it.    
 So let's look at this four@@ th fac@@ tor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each un@@ it of energ@@ y.    
 And so the question is@@ : Can you actually get that to zer@@ o@@ ?    
 If you bur@@ n co@@ al, no@@ .    
 If you bur@@ n natural g@@ as, no@@ .    
 Al@@ most every way we make elec@@ tri@@ city today, excep@@ t for the emerg@@ ing re@@ new@@ ab@@ les and nuc@@ lear@@ , pu@@ ts out CO@@ 2@@ .    
 And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scal@@ e, is create a new system.    
 And so, we need energy mirac@@ les.    
 Now, when I use the term "@@ mirac@@ le@@ ," I don't mean something that's impos@@ sib@@ le.    
 The micro@@ process@@ or is a mirac@@ le. The person@@ al computer is a mirac@@ le.    
 The Inter@@ net and its services are a mirac@@ le.    
 So, the people here have partici@@ p@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many mirac@@ les.    
 U@@ su@@ ally, we don't have a de@@ ad@@ lin@@ e, where you have to get the mirac@@ le by a certain dat@@ e.    
 U@@ su@@ ally, you just kind of stand b@@ y, and some come al@@ ong, some don@@ '@@ t.    
 This is a case where we actually have to dri@@ ve at full spe@@ ed and get a mirac@@ le in a pretty ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ ine.    
 Now, I thought, "@@ How could I really cap@@ ture this?    
 Is there some kind of natural ill@@ u@@ stra@@ tion, some de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion that would gra@@ b people@@ 's imagin@@ ation her@@ e@@ ?"    
 I thought back to a year ago when I brought m@@ os@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ s, and some@@ how people en@@ jo@@ yed that.    
   It really got them invol@@ ved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with m@@ os@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ s.    
 So, with energ@@ y, all I could come up with is this.    
 I decided that rele@@ as@@ ing fi@@ ref@@ li@@ es would be my con@@ tribu@@ tion to the environment here this year.    
 So here we have some natural fi@@ ref@@ li@@ es.    
 I'm told they don't b@@ it@@ e@@ ; in fact, they might not even leave that j@@ ar@@ .    
   Now, there's all sorts of gi@@ m@@ mic@@ k@@ y solu@@ tions like that one, but they don't really ad@@ d up to much.    
 We need solu@@ tions -- ei@@ ther one or several -- that have un@@ believ@@ able scale and un@@ believ@@ able reli@@ ab@@ il@@ ity, and, al@@ though there's many direc@@ tions people are see@@ king, I really only see five that can achi@@ eve the big numb@@ ers.    
 I've left out ti@@ de, ge@@ other@@ mal@@ , f@@ usi@@ on, bio@@ fuel@@ s.    
 Th@@ ose may make some con@@ tribu@@ tion, and if they can do better than I expec@@ t, so much the bet@@ ter, but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these fi@@ ve, and we can't give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting, because they all have signific@@ ant challeng@@ es.    
 Let's look first at the bur@@ ning f@@ os@@ si@@ l fuel@@ s, ei@@ ther bur@@ ning coal or bur@@ ning natural g@@ as@@ .    
 What you need to do there, seems like it might be simp@@ le, but it's not, and that's to take all the CO@@ 2@@ , after you've bur@@ ned it, going out the flu@@ e, pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it, create a li@@ qu@@ id@@ , put it some@@ wher@@ e, and hope it sta@@ ys there.    
 Now we have some pi@@ lot things that do this at the 6@@ 0 to 8@@ 0 percent level@@ , but getting up to that full perc@@ ent@@ age, that will be very tric@@ k@@ y, and ag@@ ree@@ ing on where these CO2 quan@@ ti@@ ties should be put will be har@@ d, but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long@@ -@@ term issu@@ e.    
 Wh@@ o@@ 's going to be su@@ re@@ ?    
 Wh@@ o@@ 's going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is literally billi@@ ons of times larg@@ er than any type of wa@@ ste you think of in terms of nuc@@ le@@ ar or other thing@@ s?    
 This is a lot of volu@@ me.    
 So that's a tou@@ gh one.    
 N@@ ext would be nuc@@ lear@@ .    
 It also has three big problem@@ s: Co@@ st, particularly in high@@ ly re@@ g@@ ul@@ ated countri@@ es, is high@@ ; the issu@@ e of the sa@@ fe@@ ty, really feeling good about nothing could go wr@@ ong, that, even though you have these human oper@@ ator@@ s, that the fu@@ el doesn't get used for we@@ ap@@ on@@ s.    
 And then what do you do with the wa@@ ste@@ ?    
 And, al@@ though it's not very larg@@ e, there are a lot of con@@ cer@@ ns about that.    
 People need to feel good about it.    
 So three very tou@@ gh problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able, and so, should be worked on.    
 The last three of the fi@@ ve, I've grou@@ ped together.    
 These are what people often ref@@ er to as the re@@ new@@ able sour@@ c@@ es.    
 And they actually -- al@@ though it's great they don't re@@ qui@@ re fu@@ el -- they have some disa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ g@@ es.    
 One is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energy ga@@ ther@@ ed in these technologi@@ es is drama@@ tically less than a power plan@@ t.    
 This is energy far@@ m@@ ing, so you're talking about many squ@@ are mil@@ es, thousands of time more area than you think of as a nor@@ mal energy plan@@ t.    
 Al@@ so, these are inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent sour@@ c@@ es.    
 The su@@ n doesn't sh@@ ine all day, it doesn't sh@@ ine every day, and, like@@ wis@@ e, the w@@ ind doesn't b@@ low all the time.    
 And so, if you dep@@ end on these sour@@ c@@ es, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ o@@ ds that it's not avail@@ able.    
 So, we've got big cost challeng@@ es here, we have tran@@ sm@@ is@@ sion challeng@@ es@@ : for example, say this energy sour@@ ce is outside your countr@@ y@@ ; you not only need the technology, but you have to deal with the ris@@ k of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ wher@@ e.    
 And, finally, this stor@@ age problem.    
 And, to di@@ men@@ sion@@ al@@ ize this, I went through and looked at all the types of bat@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- for car@@ s, for compu@@ ters, for ph@@ on@@ es, for fl@@ ash@@ light@@ s, for everything -- and comp@@ ared that to the amount of elec@@ tri@@ cal energy the world us@@ es, and what I found is that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minut@@ es of all the energ@@ y.    
 And so, in fact, we need a big brea@@ k@@ through here, something that's going to be a fac@@ tor of 100 better than the approach@@ es we have now.    
 It's not impos@@ sib@@ le, but it's not a very easy thing.    
 Now, this show@@ s up when you try to get the inter@@ m@@ it@@ t@@ ent sour@@ ce to be abo@@ ve, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're us@@ ing.    
 If you're coun@@ ting on it for 100 perc@@ ent, you need an incredi@@ ble mirac@@ le bat@@ ter@@ y.    
 Now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach@@ ?    
 Is it a Man@@ h@@ att@@ an P@@ ro@@ jec@@ t? What's the thing that can get us ther@@ e?    
 Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundre@@ ds.    
 In each of these five pa@@ th@@ s, we need at least a hundred people.    
 And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "@@ They're craz@@ y." That's goo@@ d.    
 And, I think, here in the TED grou@@ p, we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this.    
 B@@ ill G@@ ross has several comp@@ ani@@ es, including one called e@@ S@@ ol@@ ar that has some great sol@@ ar ther@@ mal technologi@@ es.    
 V@@ in@@ od K@@ h@@ os@@ la@@ 's inv@@ es@@ ting in do@@ zens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibili@@ ties, and I'm trying to help back that.    
 Na@@ than M@@ y@@ h@@ r@@ v@@ old and I actually are bac@@ king a company that, perhaps surpri@@ sing@@ ly, is actually taking the nuc@@ le@@ ar approach@@ .    
 There are some inno@@ va@@ tions in nuc@@ lear@@ : mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ar, li@@ qu@@ id@@ .    
 And inno@@ v@@ ation really stopped in this indu@@ str@@ y quite some ago, so the idea that there's some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surpri@@ s@@ ing.    
 The idea of T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ ow@@ er is that, instead of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one perc@@ ent, which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we dec@@ ide@@ d, "@@ Let's bur@@ n the 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8@@ ."    
 It is kind of a crazy idea@@ .    
 In fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never si@@ mul@@ ate proper@@ ly whether it would work or not, and so it's through the adv@@ ent of moder@@ n super@@ compu@@ ters that now you can si@@ mul@@ ate and see that, y@@ es, with the right materi@@ al@@ 's approach@@ , this looks like it would work.    
 And, because you're bur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost pro@@ fi@@ le.    
 You actually bur@@ n up the wa@@ st@@ e, and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the lef@@ to@@ ver wa@@ ste from to@@ da@@ y's reac@@ tor@@ s.    
 So, instead of wor@@ r@@ ying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing.    
 It brea@@ the@@ s this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes al@@ ong, so it's kind of like a can@@ d@@ le.    
 You can see it's a lo@@ g there, often ref@@ er@@ red to as a tra@@ vel@@ ing wa@@ ve reac@@ tor@@ .    
 In terms of fu@@ el, this really sol@@ ves the problem.    
 I've got a picture here of a place in Ken@@ tu@@ c@@ k@@ y.    
 This is the lef@@ to@@ ver, the 9@@ 9 perc@@ ent, where they@@ 've taken out the part they bur@@ n now, so it's called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ u@@ m.    
 That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years.    
 And, simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ exp@@ en@@ sive proc@@ ess, you'd have enough fu@@ el for the entire life@@ time of the rest of the planet.    
 So, you know, it's got lots of challeng@@ es a@@ hea@@ d, but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move for@@ war@@ d.    
 So let's thin@@ k@@ : How should we measure our@@ selv@@ es?    
 What should our repor@@ t c@@ ard look like@@ ?    
 Well, let's go out to where we really need to ge@@ t, and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate.    
 For 20@@ 5@@ 0, you've heard many people talk about this 8@@ 0 percent re@@ duc@@ tion.    
 That really is very import@@ ant, that we get there.    
 And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in po@@ or countri@@ es, still some ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture, hop@@ e@@ fully we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up fore@@ str@@ y, c@@ em@@ ent.    
 So, to get to that 8@@ 0 perc@@ ent, the develop@@ ed countri@@ es, including countries like Chin@@ a, will have had to s@@ wit@@ ch their elec@@ tri@@ city generation al@@ together.    
 So, the other gra@@ de is@@ : Are we dep@@ lo@@ ying this zer@@ o@@ -@@ em@@ is@@ sion technology, have we dep@@ lo@@ yed it in all the develop@@ ed countries and we're in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ wher@@ e?    
 That's su@@ per import@@ ant.    
 That's a key el@@ ement of making that repor@@ t car@@ d.    
 So, bac@@ king up from there, what should the 20@@ 20 repor@@ t c@@ ard look like@@ ?    
 Well, again, it should have the two el@@ em@@ ents.    
 We should go through these eff@@ ici@@ ency meas@@ u@@ res to start getting re@@ duc@@ tion@@ s: The less we em@@ it, the less that su@@ m will be of CO@@ 2@@ , and, ther@@ e@@ fore@@ , the less the te@@ m@@ per@@ atu@@ re.    
 But in some wa@@ ys, the gra@@ de we get there, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions, is only equ@@ ally, or maybe even sli@@ ght@@ ly l@@ ess, important than the other@@ , which is the piece of inno@@ v@@ ation on these brea@@ k@@ through@@ s.    
 These brea@@ k@@ through@@ s, we need to move those at full spe@@ ed, and we can measure that in terms of comp@@ ani@@ es, pi@@ lot projec@@ ts, re@@ g@@ ul@@ ator@@ y things that have been chan@@ ge@@ d.    
 There's a lot of great books that have been writ@@ ten about this.    
 The A@@ l G@@ or@@ e book, "O@@ ur Ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e@@ " and the D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ c@@ K@@ a@@ y book, "@@ Su@@ stain@@ able En@@ erg@@ y Wi@@ th@@ out the H@@ o@@ t A@@ ir@@ ."    
 They really go through it and create a f@@ r@@ am@@ e@@ work that this can be disc@@ us@@ sed bro@@ ad@@ ly, because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this.    
 There's a lot that has to come together.    
 So this is a wi@@ sh@@ .    
 It's a very concre@@ te w@@ ish that we inv@@ ent this technolog@@ y.    
 If you gave me only one w@@ ish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who's pres@@ id@@ ent, I could pick a vacc@@ ine, which is something I lo@@ ve, or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invent@@ ed -- this is the w@@ ish I would pic@@ k.    
 This is the one with the greatest imp@@ ac@@ t.    
 If we don't get this wi@@ sh@@ , the di@@ vi@@ sion between the people who think short term and long term will be terri@@ b@@ le, between the U.S. and Chin@@ a, between po@@ or countries and ri@@ ch, and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far wor@@ se.    
 So, what do we have to do@@ ?    
 What am I appe@@ al@@ ing to you to step forward and dri@@ ve@@ ?    
 We need to go for more research fund@@ ing.    
 When countries get together in places like C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ gen@@ , they sh@@ ouldn't just disc@@ us@@ s the CO@@ 2@@ .    
 They should disc@@ us@@ s this inno@@ v@@ ation ag@@ en@@ da@@ , and you'd be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously low level@@ s of sp@@ ending on these inno@@ va@@ tive approach@@ es. We do need the marke@@ t inc@@ enti@@ ves -- CO2 ta@@ x, ca@@ p and tra@@ de -- something that gets that pri@@ ce sig@@ n@@ al out there.    
 We need to get the messa@@ ge out.    
 We need to have this di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e be a more ra@@ tion@@ al, more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e, including the st@@ ep@@ s that the government ta@@ k@@ es.    
 This is an important wi@@ sh@@ , but it is one I think we can achiev@@ e.    
 Thank you.    
   Thank you.    
 Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : Thank you. Thank you.    
   Thank you. So to understand more about T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ ow@@ er, right -- I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of inv@@ est@@ ment this is@@ ?    
 B@@ il G@@ at@@ es@@ : To actually do the so@@ f@@ t@@ wa@@ re, buy the super@@ compu@@ ter, hi@@ re all the great scienti@@ sts, which we've don@@ e, that's only ten@@ s of milli@@ on@@ s, and even once we test our materi@@ als out in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an reac@@ tor to make sure that our materi@@ als work proper@@ ly, then you'll only be up in the hundreds of milli@@ on@@ s.    
 The tou@@ gh thing is building the pi@@ lot reac@@ tor@@ ; fin@@ ding the several billi@@ on, fin@@ ding the re@@ g@@ ul@@ at@@ or, the lo@@ cation that will actually build the first one of thes@@ e.    
 O@@ n@@ ce you get the first one buil@@ t, if it wor@@ ks as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ d, then it's just cle@@ ar as day, because the econom@@ ic@@ s, the energy den@@ s@@ ity, are so different than nuc@@ le@@ ar as we know it.    
 CA: And so, to understand it right, this invol@@ ves building de@@ ep into the grou@@ nd almost like a ver@@ tical kind of col@@ um@@ n of nuc@@ le@@ ar fu@@ el, of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ u@@ m, and then the process starts at the top and kind of wor@@ ks down@@ ?    
 B@@ G@@ : That's right. To@@ day, you're always re@@ fuel@@ ing the reac@@ tor@@ , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wr@@ ong@@ : that thing where you're op@@ ening it up and moving things in and out, that's not goo@@ d.    
 So, if you have very chea@@ p fu@@ el that you can put 6@@ 0 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ x@@ i@@ ties.    
 And it just s@@ its there and bur@@ ns for the 6@@ 0 years, and then it's don@@ e.    
 CA: It's a nuc@@ le@@ ar power plant that is its own wa@@ ste disp@@ os@@ al solu@@ tion.    
 B@@ G@@ : Yea@@ h. Well, what happens with the wa@@ st@@ e, you can let it s@@ it there -- there's a lot less wa@@ ste under this appro@@ ach -- then you can actually take that, and put it into another one and bur@@ n that.    
 And we start off actually by taking the wa@@ ste that exist@@ s today, that's sitting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ol@@ s or d@@ ry cas@@ king by reac@@ tors -- that's our fu@@ el to begin with@@ .    
 So, the thing that's been a problem from those reac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into our@@ s, and you're re@@ duc@@ ing the volu@@ me of the wa@@ ste quite drama@@ tically as you're going through this proc@@ ess.    
 CA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the world about the possibili@@ ties here.    
 Wh@@ ere is there most inter@@ est in actually doing something with this?    
 B@@ G@@ : Well, we haven't pic@@ ked a particular plac@@ e, and there's all these interesting disc@@ lo@@ sure rul@@ es about anything that's called "@@ nuc@@ lear@@ ," so we've got a lot of interes@@ t, that people from the company have been in R@@ us@@ si@@ a, Indi@@ a, Chin@@ a -- I've been back seeing the secre@@ t@@ ary of energy here, talking about how this f@@ its into the energy ag@@ en@@ da@@ .    
 So I'm op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic. You know, the F@@ ren@@ ch and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese have done some work.    
 This is a vari@@ ant on something that has been don@@ e.    
 It's an important adv@@ anc@@ e, but it's like a fast reac@@ tor@@ , and a lot of countries have built them, so anybody who's done a fast reac@@ tor is a can@@ di@@ d@@ ate to be where the first one gets buil@@ t.    
 CA: So, in your min@@ d, tim@@ es@@ cal@@ e and like@@ li@@ hood of actually taking something like this liv@@ e?    
 B@@ G@@ : Well, we need -- for one of these high@@ -@@ scal@@ e, elec@@ tro@@ -@@ generation things that's very chea@@ p, we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to dep@@ lo@@ y.    
 That's sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environ@@ mental model@@ s have shown us that we have to me@@ e@@ t.    
 And, you know, T@@ er@@ ra@@ P@@ ow@@ er, if things go well -- which is wi@@ sh@@ ing for a lot -- could eas@@ ily meet that.    
 And there are, fortun@@ ately now, do@@ zens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- wh@@ o, like@@ wis@@ e, if their science goes well, if the fund@@ ing for their pi@@ lot plan@@ ts goes well, that they can compe@@ te for this.    
 And it's best if multi@@ ple succ@@ e@@ ed, because then you could use a mi@@ x of these things.    
 We certainly need one to succ@@ e@@ ed.    
 CA: In terms of bi@@ g@@ -@@ scale possible game chang@@ es, is this the biggest that you're aw@@ are of out ther@@ e?    
 B@@ G@@ : A@@ n energy brea@@ k@@ through is the most important thing.    
 It would have be@@ en, even without the environ@@ mental con@@ stra@@ in@@ t, but the environ@@ mental con@@ stra@@ in@@ t just makes it so much great@@ er.    
 In the nuc@@ le@@ ar space, there are other inno@@ v@@ ator@@ s.    
 You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one, but the mo@@ du@@ lar people, that's a different approach@@ .    
 There's a li@@ qu@@ id@@ -@@ type reac@@ tor@@ , which seems a little har@@ d, but maybe they say that about us.    
 And so, there are different on@@ es, but the beau@@ ty of this is a mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a mo@@ le@@ cu@@ le of, say, co@@ al, and so -- if you can deal with the nega@@ tiv@@ es, which are ess@@ entially the radi@@ ation -- the foo@@ t@@ prin@@ t and co@@ st, the pot@@ enti@@ al, in terms of effec@@ t on land and vari@@ ous things, is almost in a class of its ow@@ n.    
 CA: If this doesn't work, then what@@ ?    
 Do we have to start taking emerg@@ ency meas@@ u@@ res to try and keep the te@@ m@@ per@@ atu@@ re of the ear@@ th st@@ ab@@ le@@ ?    
 B@@ G@@ : If you get into that situ@@ ation, it's like if you've been over@@ -@@ e@@ at@@ ing, and you're about to have a heart att@@ ack@@ : Then where do you go@@ ? You may need heart surg@@ ery or some@@ thing.    
 There is a line of research on what's called ge@@ o@@ engine@@ er@@ ing, which are vari@@ ous techniques that would del@@ a@@ y the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.    
 Now, that's just an in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce polic@@ y.    
 You hope you don't need to do that.    
 Some people say you sh@@ ouldn't even work on the in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce polic@@ y because it might make you la@@ z@@ y, that you'll keep e@@ ating because you know heart surg@@ ery will be there to save you.    
 I'm not sure that's wis@@ e, given the import@@ ance of the proble@@ m, but there's now the ge@@ o@@ engine@@ ering disc@@ us@@ sion about -- should that be in the back po@@ c@@ ket in case things happen fa@@ st@@ er, or this inno@@ v@@ ation goes a lot s@@ low@@ er than we expec@@ t?    
 CA: C@@ lim@@ ate sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s: If you had a s@@ ent@@ ence or two to say to them, how might you per@@ su@@ ad@@ e them that they're wr@@ ong@@ ?    
 B@@ G@@ : Well, un@@ fortun@@ ately, the sk@@ ep@@ tics come in different camp@@ s.    
 The ones who make scientific argu@@ ments are very fe@@ w@@ .    
 that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ set thing@@ s?    
 There are very, very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things.    
 The main problem we have here, it's kind of like A@@ I@@ D@@ S.    
 You make the mista@@ ke now, and you pa@@ y for it a lot lat@@ er.    
 And so, when you have all sorts of ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s, the idea of taking pa@@ in now that has to do with a ga@@ in later, and a some@@ what un@@ certain pa@@ in thing -- in fact, the I@@ P@@ C@@ C repor@@ t, that's not necess@@ arily the worst case, and there are people in the rich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say, "O@@ K@@ , that isn't that big of a de@@ al@@ ."    
 The fact is it's that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this.    
 But my dream here is that, if you can make it econom@@ ic, and meet the CO2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts, then the sk@@ ep@@ tics say, "O@@ K@@ , I don't care that it doesn't put out CO@@ 2@@ , I kind of w@@ ish it did put out CO@@ 2@@ , but I gu@@ ess I'll acc@@ ept it because it's chea@@ per than what's come before@@ ."    
   CA: And so, that would be your respon@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g argu@@ ment, that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 proble@@ m, it's going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of po@@ ver@@ ty and mal@@ ari@@ a and so for@@ th, it's a stu@@ pi@@ d wa@@ ste of the Ear@@ th@@ 's resour@@ ces to put money towards that B@@ G@@ : Well, the actu@@ al sp@@ ending on the R@@ &@@ D piece --    
 say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it's not that drama@@ tic.    
 It sh@@ ouldn't take away from other things.    
 The thing you get into big money on, and this, reas@@ on@@ able people can disa@@ gre@@ e, is when you have something that's n@@ on-@@ econom@@ ic and you're trying to fu@@ nd that -- that, to me, mo@@ st@@ ly is a wa@@ st@@ e.    
 Un@@ less you're very close and you're just fund@@ ing the learning cur@@ ve and it's going to get very chea@@ p, I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve.    
 If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is, "@@ Let's make energy su@@ per exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve@@ ," then the rich can aff@@ ord that.    
 I mean, all of us here could pa@@ y five times as much for our energy and not change our lif@@ es@@ ty@@ le.    
 The disa@@ ster is for that two billi@@ on.    
 And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has chan@@ ge@@ d.    
 H@@ is sh@@ tic@@ k now is, "@@ Why isn't the R@@ &@@ D getting more disc@@ us@@ se@@ d@@ ?"    
 H@@ e's sti@@ ll@@ , because of his earli@@ er stuff@@ , still as@@ soci@@ ated with the sk@@ ep@@ tic camp@@ , but he's realized that's a pretty l@@ on@@ ely camp@@ , and so, he's making the R@@ &@@ D poin@@ t.    
 And so there is a th@@ read of something that I think is appro@@ pri@@ ate.    
 The R@@ &@@ D piec@@ e, it's crazy how little it's fun@@ de@@ d.    
 CA: Well B@@ ill@@ , I s@@ us@@ pect I speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say I really hope your w@@ ish comes tru@@ e. Thank you so much.    
 B@@ G@@ : Thank you.    
 I'd like to share with you a dis@@ co@@ very that I made a few months ago while writing an ar@@ tic@@ le for Ital@@ ian Wi@@ re@@ d.    
 I always keep my thes@@ a@@ ur@@ us han@@ dy wh@@ en@@ ever I'm writing any@@ thing, but I'd already fin@@ ish@@ ed ed@@ iting the piec@@ e, and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word "@@ disab@@ le@@ d@@ " to see what I'd fin@@ d.    
 L@@ et me read you the ent@@ r@@ y.    
 "D@@ is@@ ab@@ le@@ d, ad@@ jec@@ tiv@@ e: cri@@ pp@@ le@@ d, hel@@ pl@@ ess, us@@ el@@ ess, w@@ rec@@ ke@@ d, st@@ al@@ le@@ d, ma@@ i@@ me@@ d, w@@ oun@@ ded, man@@ g@@ le@@ d, l@@ am@@ e, mu@@ ti@@ lat@@ ed, run@@ -@@ dow@@ n, wor@@ n@@ -@@ out, we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed, im@@ pot@@ ent, ca@@ str@@ ated, par@@ aly@@ z@@ ed, han@@ di@@ cap@@ pe@@ d, sen@@ i@@ le, de@@ cre@@ p@@ it, la@@ id@@ -@@ up, don@@ e-@@ up, don@@ e-@@ for@@ , don@@ e-@@ in crac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up, coun@@ te@@ d-@@ out@@ ; see also h@@ ur@@ t, us@@ el@@ ess and wea@@ k.    
 An@@ ton@@ y@@ ms, health@@ y, str@@ ong, cap@@ ab@@ le@@ ."    
 I was reading this li@@ st out l@@ oud to a friend and at first was la@@ ugh@@ ing, it was so lu@@ dic@@ rou@@ s, but I'd just gotten past "@@ man@@ g@@ le@@ d@@ ," and my vo@@ ice bro@@ ke, and I had to stop and colle@@ ct myself from the emo@@ tional sh@@ oc@@ k and impact that the as@@ sa@@ ult from these words un@@ le@@ as@@ he@@ d.    
 You know, of course, this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ a@@ ur@@ us so I'm thinking this must be an ancient prin@@ t dat@@ e, right?    
 But, in fact, the prin@@ t d@@ ate was the ear@@ ly 19@@ 80@@ s, when I would have been starting pri@@ mar@@ y school and for@@ m@@ ing an understanding of myself outside the family un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other kids and the world around me.    
 And, need@@ less to say, th@@ ank G@@ od I wasn't using a thes@@ a@@ ur@@ us back th@@ en.    
 I mean, from this ent@@ r@@ y, it would seem that I was born into a world that perc@@ ei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing posi@@ tive what@@ so@@ ever going for them, when in fact, today I'm c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated for the oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties and ad@@ ven@@ tures my life has pro@@ cu@@ re@@ d.    
 So, I im@@ medi@@ ately went to look up the 200@@ 9 online edi@@ tion, expec@@ ting to find a re@@ vi@@ sion worth no@@ t@@ ing.    
 Here's the up@@ d@@ ated ver@@ sion of this ent@@ r@@ y.    
 Un@@ fortun@@ ately, it's not much better.    
 I find the last two words under "@@ N@@ ea@@ r An@@ ton@@ y@@ m@@ s@@ ," particularly un@@ se@@ tt@@ l@@ ing@@ : "@@ who@@ le@@ " and "@@ wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome@@ ."    
 So, it's not just about the wor@@ ds.    
 It's what we believe about people when we name them with these wor@@ ds.    
 It's about the valu@@ es behind the words, and how we construc@@ t those valu@@ es.    
 Our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people.    
 In fact, many ancient socie@@ ties, including the G@@ ree@@ ks and the R@@ om@@ an@@ s, believ@@ ed that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so power@@ ful, because to say the thing out l@@ oud brought it into exist@@ ence.    
 So, what reality do we want to call into exist@@ enc@@ e: a person who is lim@@ it@@ ed, or a person who's em@@ power@@ ed@@ ?    
 By ca@@ su@@ ally doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a pers@@ on, a chil@@ d, we might be putting li@@ ds and ca@@ sting sha@@ dow@@ s on their pow@@ er.    
 W@@ ouldn't we want to open do@@ ors for them in@@ ste@@ ad@@ ?    
 One such person who op@@ ened do@@ ors for me was my child@@ hood doctor at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t In@@ stitu@@ te in W@@ il@@ m@@ ing@@ t@@ on, D@@ el@@ a@@ wa@@ re.    
 H@@ is name was D@@ r. P@@ iz@@ z@@ u@@ til@@ lo@@ , an Ital@@ ian Americ@@ an, wh@@ ose nam@@ e, app@@ aren@@ t@@ ly, was too difficult for most Americ@@ ans to p@@ ron@@ oun@@ ce, so he went by D@@ r. P@@ .    
 And D@@ r. P always wor@@ e really color@@ ful b@@ ow ties and had the very perfect disp@@ os@@ i@@ tion to work with children@@ .    
 I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hosp@@ it@@ al, with the excep@@ tion of my physical ther@@ ap@@ y ses@@ sion@@ s.    
 I had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions of ex@@ er@@ ci@@ ses with these th@@ ic@@ k, el@@ as@@ tic b@@ ands -- different color@@ s, you know -- to help build up my le@@ g mus@@ cl@@ es, and I h@@ ated these b@@ ands more than anything -- I h@@ ated them, had nam@@ es for them. I h@@ ated them.    
 And, you know, I was already bar@@ g@@ ain@@ ing, as a five year-@@ old chil@@ d, with D@@ r. P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ er@@ ci@@ s@@ es, un@@ success@@ ful@@ ly, of cour@@ se.    
 And, one day, he came in to my ses@@ sion -- ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tive and un@@ for@@ gi@@ v@@ ing, these ses@@ sions -- and he said to me, "@@ W@@ ow@@ . A@@ i@@ me@@ e, you are such a strong and powerful little girl@@ , I think you're going to break one of those ban@@ ds.    
 When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred b@@ uck@@ s."    
 Now, of course, this was a simple p@@ lo@@ y on D@@ r. P@@ 's part to get me to do the ex@@ er@@ ci@@ ses I didn't want to do before the pro@@ spe@@ ct of being the ri@@ ch@@ est fi@@ ve@@ -year-old in the second flo@@ or war@@ d, but what he effec@@ tively did for me was res@@ ha@@ pe an aw@@ ful da@@ ily oc@@ cur@@ ren@@ ce into a new and prom@@ is@@ ing experience for me.    
 and his de@@ cl@@ ar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl sha@@ ped my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently str@@ ong, powerful and a@@ th@@ le@@ tic person well into the fu@@ ture.    
 This is an example of how adul@@ ts in posi@@ tions of power can ig@@ n@@ ite the power of a chil@@ d.    
 But, in the pre@@ vi@@ ous instan@@ ces of those thes@@ a@@ ur@@ us ent@@ ri@@ es, our language isn't allow@@ ing us to ev@@ ol@@ ve into the reality that we would all wan@@ t, the possib@@ ility of an individual to see themselves as cap@@ able.    
 Our language ha@@ s@@ n't caught up with the changes in our societ@@ y, many of which have been brought about by technolog@@ y.    
 C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly, from a medi@@ cal stand@@ poin@@ t, my leg@@ s, las@@ er surg@@ ery for vi@@ sion imp@@ air@@ ment, ti@@ t@@ ani@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ em@@ ents for ag@@ ing bodies that are allow@@ ing people to more fully eng@@ age with their ab@@ ili@@ ties, and move beyond the lim@@ its that nature has imp@@ osed on them -- not to men@@ tion social net@@ working pl@@ at@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identi@@ f@@ y, to cla@@ i@@ m their own descri@@ p@@ tions of them@@ selv@@ es, so they can go al@@ ign with global grou@@ ps of their own choos@@ ing.    
 So, perhaps technology is re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing more c@@ lear@@ ly to us now what has always been a tru@@ th@@ : that everyone has something r@@ are and powerful to offer our societ@@ y, and that the human ability to adap@@ t is our greatest as@@ se@@ t.    
 The human ability to adap@@ t, it's an interesting thing, because people have contin@@ u@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity, and I'm going to make an ad@@ mis@@ sion@@ : This ph@@ r@@ ase never s@@ at right with me, and I always felt u@@ ne@@ as@@ y trying to answer people@@ 's questions about it, and I think I'm starting to figure out wh@@ y.    
 I@@ mp@@ lic@@ it in this ph@@ r@@ ase of "@@ over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sit@@ y@@ " is the idea that succ@@ ess, or happin@@ ess, is about emerg@@ ing on the other side of a challeng@@ ing experience un@@ s@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experienc@@ e, as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to sid@@ es@@ te@@ p or cir@@ cu@@ m@@ na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate the pre@@ sum@@ ed p@@ it@@ f@@ all@@ s of a life with pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic@@ s, or what other people perc@@ ei@@ ve as my disab@@ ility.    
 But, in fact, we are chan@@ ge@@ d. We are marke@@ d, of course, by a challeng@@ e, whether physic@@ ally, emo@@ tion@@ ally or bo@@ th.    
 And I'm going to sugg@@ est that this is a good thing.    
 A@@ d@@ versity isn't an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in order to re@@ su@@ me living our life.    
 It's part of our life.    
 And I t@@ end to think of it like my sha@@ dow@@ .    
 Some@@ times I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very litt@@ le, but it's always with me.    
 And, certain@@ ly, I'm not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the imp@@ ac@@ t, the we@@ i@@ ght, of a person@@ 's stru@@ gg@@ le.    
 There is ad@@ versity and challenge in life, and it's all very real and rela@@ tive to every single pers@@ on, but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet ad@@ vers@@ ity, but how you're going to meet it.    
 So, our respon@@ sib@@ ility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ vers@@ ity, but pre@@ par@@ ing them to meet it well.    
 And we do a dis@@ ser@@ vice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not e@@ qui@@ pped to adap@@ t.    
 There's an important difference and dist@@ inc@@ tion between the objec@@ tive medi@@ cal fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ te@@ e and the subjec@@ tive societ@@ al opini@@ on of whether or not I'm disab@@ le@@ d.    
 And, tru@@ th@@ ful@@ ly, the only real and con@@ sist@@ ent dis@@ ability I've had to conf@@ ront is the world ever thinking that I could be descri@@ bed by those defin@@ i@@ tions.    
 In our des@@ i@@ re to prote@@ ct those we care about by giving them the col@@ d, hard truth about their medi@@ cal pro@@ g@@ no@@ si@@ s, or, in@@ de@@ ed, a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis on the expec@@ ted qu@@ ality of their life, we have to make sure that we don't put the first bri@@ ck in a w@@ all that will actually dis@@ able some@@ one.    
 P@@ er@@ ha@@ ps the exist@@ ing model of only looking at what is bro@@ ken in you and how do we fi@@ x it, ser@@ ves to be more disab@@ ling to the individual than the pa@@ tho@@ logy it@@ self.    
 By not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a pers@@ on, by not ac@@ knowle@@ dg@@ ing their pot@@ enc@@ y, we are creating another ill on top of what@@ ever natural stru@@ gg@@ le they might ha@@ ve.    
 We are effec@@ tively gra@@ ding some@@ one's worth to our commun@@ ity.    
 So we need to see through the pa@@ tho@@ logy and into the ran@@ ge of human cap@@ ab@@ ility.    
 And, most import@@ ant@@ ly, there's a part@@ ner@@ ship between those perc@@ ei@@ ved de@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ ci@@ es and our greatest creative ab@@ ility.    
 So it's not about de@@ valu@@ ing, or ne@@ g@@ at@@ ing, these more trying times as something we want to a@@ vo@@ id or s@@ wee@@ p under the ru@@ g, but instead to find those oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties w@@ ra@@ pped in the ad@@ vers@@ ity.    
 So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ versity as it is op@@ ening ourselves up to it, em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing it, gra@@ pp@@ ling with it, to use a w@@ re@@ st@@ ling ter@@ m, maybe even danc@@ ing with it.    
 And, perha@@ ps, if we see ad@@ versity as n@@ atur@@ al, con@@ sist@@ ent and us@@ e@@ ful, we're less bur@@ d@@ ened by the pres@@ ence of it.    
 This year we c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate the 200@@ th bir@@ th@@ day of Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in, and it was 1@@ 50 years ago, when writing about evolu@@ tion, that D@@ ar@@ win ill@@ u@@ str@@ ated, I think, a truth about the human charac@@ ter.    
 To par@@ a@@ ph@@ r@@ as@@ e: It's not the str@@ ong@@ est of the species that survi@@ ves, no@@ r is it the most intellig@@ ent that survi@@ v@@ es@@ ; it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change.    
 Con@@ f@@ li@@ ct is the gen@@ es@@ is of crea@@ tion.    
 F@@ rom D@@ ar@@ win@@ 's work, am@@ ong@@ st other@@ s, we can recog@@ n@@ ize that the human ability to survi@@ ve and fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h is dri@@ ven by the stru@@ gg@@ le of the human spi@@ rit through conf@@ li@@ ct into trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tion.    
 So, again, trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tion, adap@@ ta@@ tion, is our greatest human sk@@ ill@@ .    
 And, perha@@ ps, until we're tes@@ ted, we don't know what we're made of.    
 Maybe that's what ad@@ versity gi@@ ves us@@ : a sense of self, a sense of our own pow@@ er.    
 So, we can give ourselves a gi@@ f@@ t.    
 We can re@@ -@@ imagine ad@@ versity as something more than just tou@@ gh times.    
 Maybe we can see it as change.    
 A@@ d@@ versity is just change that we haven't adap@@ ted ourselves to ye@@ t.    
 I think the greatest ad@@ versity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normal@@ c@@ y.    
 Now, who's normal@@ ?    
 There's no normal@@ .    
 There's com@@ mon@@ , there's ty@@ pic@@ al. There's no normal@@ , and would you want to meet that po@@ or, be@@ i@@ ge person if they exist@@ ed@@ ?    
   I don't think so@@ .    
 If we can change this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m from one of achiev@@ ing normal@@ c@@ y to one of possib@@ ility -- or pot@@ enc@@ y, to be even a little bit more danger@@ ous -- we can rele@@ ase the power of so many more children, and inv@@ ite them to eng@@ age their r@@ are and valu@@ able ab@@ ili@@ ties with the commun@@ ity.    
 An@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ logi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as human@@ s have always re@@ qui@@ red of our community memb@@ ers is to be of us@@ e, to be able to con@@ tribu@@ t@@ e.    
 There's evidence that N@@ e@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als, 6@@ 0@@ ,000 years ago, car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with seri@@ ous physical in@@ j@@ ur@@ y, and perhaps it's because the life experience of survi@@ v@@ al of these people pro@@ ved of value to the commun@@ ity.    
 They didn't view these people as bro@@ ken and us@@ el@@ ess@@ ; they were seen as r@@ are and valu@@ able.    
 A few years ago, I was in a food marke@@ t in the town where I grew up in that red z@@ one in nor@@ the@@ a@@ ster@@ n P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a, and I was standing over a bus@@ h@@ el of tom@@ at@@ o@@ es.    
 It was sum@@ mer@@ ti@@ me@@ : I had shor@@ ts on.    
 I hear this gu@@ y, his vo@@ ice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't A@@ i@@ me@@ e M@@ ul@@ lin@@ s."    
 And I turn aroun@@ d, and it's this ol@@ der man@@ . I have no idea who he is.    
 And I said, "I'm sor@@ r@@ y, si@@ r@@ , have we me@@ t? I don't remember me@@ e@@ ting you@@ ."    
 He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember me@@ e@@ ting me.    
 I mean, when we met I was deli@@ ver@@ ing you from your mother@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ."    
   O@@ h, that gu@@ y.    
 And, but of course, actu@@ ally, it did c@@ lic@@ k.    
 This man was D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an, a man that I had only known about through my mother@@ 's stories of that day, be@@ cause, of course, typical fas@@ hi@@ on, I arri@@ ved l@@ ate for my bir@@ th@@ day by two wee@@ ks.    
 And so my mother@@ 's pre@@ n@@ at@@ al physic@@ ian had gone on va@@ cation, so the man who deli@@ ver@@ ed me was a comple@@ te strang@@ er to my paren@@ ts.    
 And, because I was born without the fi@@ bul@@ a bon@@ es, and had fe@@ et turned in, and a few to@@ es in this foo@@ t and a few to@@ es in that, he had to be the be@@ are@@ r -- this strang@@ er had to be the be@@ are@@ r of bad new@@ s.    
 He said to me, "I had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis to your parents that you would never wal@@ k, and you would never have the kind of mo@@ b@@ ility that other kids have or any kind of life of in@@ dep@@ end@@ ence, and you've been making li@@ ar out of me ever sin@@ c@@ e."    
     The extraordinary thing is that he said he had sa@@ ved new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er cli@@ pp@@ ings through@@ out my whole child@@ h@@ oo@@ d, whether win@@ ning a second gra@@ de sp@@ ell@@ ing be@@ e, mar@@ ching with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ cou@@ ts, you know, the H@@ al@@ lo@@ we@@ en par@@ ad@@ e, win@@ ning my colle@@ ge sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p, or any of my sp@@ or@@ ts vic@@ tor@@ ies, and he was using it, and inte@@ gr@@ ating it into teach@@ ing resid@@ ent stud@@ ents, med students from H@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man@@ n M@@ edi@@ cal S@@ ch@@ ool and H@@ er@@ sh@@ ey M@@ edi@@ cal S@@ chool@@ .    
 And he called this part of the course the X F@@ ac@@ tor@@ , the potential of the human will@@ . No pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can ac@@ coun@@ t for how powerful this could be as a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ant in the qu@@ ality of some@@ one's life.    
 And D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me, he said, "@@ In my experienc@@ e, un@@ less re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told other@@ wis@@ e, and even if given a mo@@ di@@ cu@@ m of supp@@ or@@ t, if left to their own de@@ vic@@ es, a child will achiev@@ e."    
 Se@@ e, D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an made that shi@@ ft in thin@@ king.    
 He underst@@ ood that there's a difference between the medi@@ cal condi@@ tion and what someone might do with it.    
 And there's been a shi@@ ft in my thinking over time, in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old, if I would have tra@@ ded pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ b@@ one leg@@ s, I wouldn't have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a secon@@ d.    
 I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of normal@@ c@@ y back th@@ en.    
 But if you ask me today, I'm not so su@@ re.    
 And it's because of the experienc@@ es I've had with them, not in sp@@ ite of the experienc@@ es I've had with them.    
 And perhaps this shi@@ ft in me has happened because I've been ex@@ pos@@ ed to more people who have op@@ ened do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and ca@@ st sha@@ dow@@ s on me.    
 Se@@ e, all you really need is one person If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spi@@ rit is so rec@@ ep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cru@@ ci@@ al mom@@ ent, you are educ@@ ating them in the best sen@@ se.    
 You're teach@@ ing them to open do@@ ors for them@@ selves.    
 In fact, the ex@@ act mean@@ ing of the word "@@ educ@@ at@@ e@@ " comes from the roo@@ t word "@@ educ@@ e."    
 It means "@@ to bring for@@ th what is wi@@ thin@@ , to bring out pot@@ enti@@ al@@ ."    
 So again, which potential do we want to bring out@@ ?    
 There was a case study done in 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s Br@@ it@@ ain@@ , when they were moving from gr@@ am@@ ma@@ r school@@ s to comp@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ sive school@@ s.    
 It's called the stre@@ am@@ ing tri@@ als. We call it "@@ tr@@ ack@@ ing@@ " here in the St@@ at@@ es.    
 It's se@@ par@@ ating students from A@@ , B@@ , C@@ , D and so on.    
 And the "@@ A stud@@ ent@@ s@@ " get the tou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ u@@ m, the best te@@ ac@@ her@@ s, et@@ c@@ .    
 Well, they too@@ k, over a th@@ ree@@ -@@ mon@@ th peri@@ o@@ d, D@@ -@@ level stud@@ ents, gave them A@@ '@@ s, told them they were "A@@ '@@ s@@ ," told them they were bri@@ ght, and at the end of this th@@ ree@@ -@@ mon@@ th peri@@ o@@ d, And, of course, the hear@@ t@@ brea@@ king, f@@ li@@ p side of this stud@@ y, is that they took the "@@ A stud@@ ent@@ s@@ " and told them they were "D@@ '@@ s."    
 And that's what happened at the end of that th@@ ree@@ -@@ mon@@ th peri@@ o@@ d.    
 A cru@@ ci@@ al part of this case study was that the teach@@ ers were du@@ ped too@@ .    
 The teach@@ ers didn't know a s@@ wit@@ ch had been ma@@ de.    
 They were simply t@@ old, "@@ These are the '@@ A@@ -@@ stud@@ ent@@ s@@ ,@@ ' these are the '@@ D@@ -@@ stud@@ ent@@ s@@ .@@ '@@ " And that's how they went about teach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them.    
 So, I think that the only tru@@ e dis@@ ability is a cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed spir@@ it, a spi@@ rit that's been cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed doesn't have hop@@ e, it doesn't see beau@@ ty, it no longer has our n@@ atur@@ al, child@@ like curi@@ os@@ ity and our in@@ n@@ ate ability to imagin@@ e.    
 If instea@@ d, we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human spi@@ rit to keep hop@@ e, to see beau@@ ty in themselves and other@@ s, to be curi@@ ous and imagin@@ a@@ tive, then we are truly using our power well.    
 When a spi@@ rit has those qu@@ ali@@ ties, we are able to create new real@@ i@@ ties and new ways of be@@ ing.    
 I'd like to leave you with a po@@ e@@ m by a four@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ centur@@ y P@@ er@@ si@@ an po@@ et nam@@ ed H@@ a@@ fi@@ z that my fri@@ end, J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es D@@ em@@ bo@@ is told me ab@@ out, and the po@@ e@@ m is called "The G@@ od Who O@@ n@@ ly K@@ now@@ s F@@ our W@@ ord@@ s@@ "@@ : "@@ Every child has known Go@@ d, not the G@@ od of nam@@ es, not the G@@ od of don@@ '@@ ts, but the G@@ od who only knows four words and keep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them, say@@ ing, '@@ C@@ ome d@@ ance with me.

 You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably Ameri@@ ca@@ 's most w@@ id@@ ely read children@@ 's au@@ th@@ or, in fac@@ t.    
 And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scienti@@ st.    
 You can have me as a far@@ m@@ er, or in lea@@ ther@@ s, and no one has ever ch@@ ose far@@ mer@@ .    
 I'm here today to talk to you about cir@@ cl@@ es and ep@@ i@@ ph@@ ani@@ es.    
 And you know, an ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dro@@ pped some@@ plac@@ e.    
 You@@ 've just got to go around the b@@ lo@@ ck to see it as an ep@@ i@@ ph@@ an@@ y.    
 That's a pain@@ ting of a cir@@ c@@ le.    
 A friend of m@@ ine did that -- Ri@@ ch@@ ard B@@ ol@@ l@@ ing@@ bro@@ k@@ e.    
 It's the kind of complicated cir@@ cle that I'm going to tell you ab@@ out.    
 My cir@@ cle began back in the '@@ 6@@ 0@@ s in high school in S@@ tow@@ , O@@ hi@@ o where I was the class qu@@ e@@ er.    
 I was the guy be@@ at@@ en up bloo@@ dy every week in the bo@@ y@@ s' room@@ , until one te@@ ac@@ her sa@@ ved my life.    
 She sa@@ ved my life by le@@ tting me go to the ba@@ th@@ room in the te@@ ac@@ her@@ s' l@@ oun@@ g@@ e.    
 She did it in secre@@ t.    
 She did it for three years.    
 And I had to get out of tow@@ n.    
 I had a th@@ u@@ mb@@ , I had 8@@ 5 dollar@@ s, and I ended up in S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co@@ , Californi@@ a -- met a lo@@ ver -- and back in the '@@ 80@@ s, found it necess@@ ary to begin work on A@@ I@@ D@@ S organ@@ iz@@ a@@ tions.    
 A@@ b@@ out three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the ni@@ ght from that teach@@ er, M@@ r@@ s. P@@ o@@ st@@ en, who said, "I need to see you.    
 I'm disap@@ poin@@ ted that we never got to know each other as adul@@ ts.    
 C@@ ould you please come to O@@ hi@@ o, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now.    
 And I should men@@ tion that I have pan@@ crea@@ tic can@@ c@@ er, and I'd like you to please be quic@@ k about this@@ ."    
 Well, the next day we were in C@@ level@@ an@@ d.    
 We took a look at her, we la@@ ugh@@ ed, we cri@@ ed, and we knew that she needed to be in a h@@ os@@ pic@@ e.    
 We found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and wat@@ ched over her family, because it was necess@@ ary.    
 It's something we knew how to do.    
 And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an ad@@ ult got to know me, she turned into a bo@@ x of ash@@ es and was plac@@ ed in my han@@ ds.    
 And what had happened was the cir@@ cle had close@@ d, it had become a cir@@ cle -- and that ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any I talked about present@@ ed it@@ self.    
 The ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life.    
 She sa@@ ved my life@@ ; I and my part@@ ner sa@@ ved her@@ s.    
 And you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life do@@ es.    
 It needs truth and beau@@ ty, and I'm so happy it's been men@@ tion@@ ed so much here today.    
 It also needs -- it needs dig@@ n@@ ity, love and ple@@ as@@ u@@ re, and it's our job to hand those things out.    
 Thank you.    
 As an arti@@ st, connec@@ tion is very important to me.    
 Th@@ rou@@ gh my work I'm trying to ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ate that human@@ s are not se@@ par@@ ate from nature and that everything is inter@@ connec@@ ted.    
 I first went to An@@ tar@@ c@@ tic@@ a almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s.    
 I was in aw@@ e.    
 My heart be@@ at fa@@ st, my head was di@@ z@@ z@@ y, trying to comp@@ re@@ h@@ end what it was that st@@ ood in front of me.    
 The ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s around me were almost 2@@ 00 fe@@ et out of the wat@@ er, and I could only help but won@@ der that this was one s@@ now@@ fla@@ ke on top of another s@@ now@@ fla@@ ke, year after year.    
 I@@ c@@ eb@@ erg@@ s are born when they cal@@ ve off of g@@ l@@ ac@@ i@@ ers or break off of ice sh@@ el@@ v@@ es.    
 E@@ ach ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g has its own individual person@@ al@@ ity.    
 They have a dist@@ in@@ ct way of interac@@ ting with their environment and their experienc@@ es.    
 Some ref@@ use to give up and hold on to the b@@ it@@ ter end, while other@@ s can't take it any@@ more and cru@@ mb@@ le in a fit of drama@@ tic pas@@ sion.    
 It's easy to think, when you look at an ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ , that they're is@@ ol@@ ated, that they're se@@ par@@ ate and al@@ one, much like we as human@@ s sometimes view our@@ selves.    
 But the reality is far from it.    
 As an ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g m@@ el@@ ts, I am brea@@ thing in its ancient at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ e.    
 As the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g m@@ el@@ ts, it is rele@@ as@@ ing min@@ er@@ al@@ -@@ rich f@@ res@@ h water that n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ es many forms of life.    
 I appro@@ ach photograph@@ ing these ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s as if I'm making por@@ tra@@ its of my anc@@ es@@ tor@@ s, know@@ ing that in these individual moments they ex@@ ist in that way It is not a death when they m@@ el@@ t@@ ; it is not an end, but a contin@@ u@@ ation of their pat@@ h through the cy@@ cle of life.    
 Some of the ice in the ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s that I photo@@ gra@@ p@@ h is very young -- a couple thous@@ and years ol@@ d.    
 And some of the ice is over 1@@ 00@@ ,000 years ol@@ d.    
 The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g that I photograph@@ ed in Q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q@@ , Gre@@ en@@ lan@@ d.    
 It's a very r@@ are oc@@ ca@@ sion that you get to actually wit@@ ness an ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g ro@@ ll@@ ing.    
 So here it is.    
 You can see on the left side a small bo@@ at.    
 That's about a 1@@ 5@@ -@@ foo@@ t bo@@ at.    
 to the shape of the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g and where it is at the wat@@ er@@ lin@@ e.    
 You can see here, it beg@@ ins to ro@@ ll@@ , and the bo@@ at has moved to the other sid@@ e, and the man is standing there.    
 This is an aver@@ a@@ ge@@ -@@ si@@ ze Gre@@ en@@ lan@@ di@@ c ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ .    
 It's about 1@@ 20 fe@@ et abo@@ ve the wat@@ er, or 40 me@@ ters.    
 And this video is real time.    
   And just like that, the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ g show@@ s you a different side of its person@@ al@@ ity.    
 Thank you.    
 I want you to imagine two cou@@ ples in the middle of 19@@ 7@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day, at the ex@@ act same mom@@ ent, each con@@ c@@ ei@@ ving a b@@ ab@@ y -- oka@@ y?    
 So two cou@@ ples each con@@ c@@ ei@@ ving one b@@ ab@@ y.    
 Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagin@@ ing the concep@@ tion, because if you spend all that time imagin@@ ing that concep@@ tion, you're not going to list@@ en to me.    
 So just imagine that for a mom@@ ent.    
 And in this scen@@ ari@@ o, the s@@ per@@ m is car@@ r@@ ying a Y chromos@@ om@@ e, me@@ e@@ ting that X chromos@@ ome of the e@@ gg@@ .    
 And in the other case, the s@@ per@@ m is car@@ r@@ ying an X chromos@@ om@@ e, me@@ e@@ ting the X chromos@@ ome of the e@@ gg@@ .    
 B@@ o@@ th are vi@@ ab@@ le@@ ; both take off.    
 We@@ 'll come back to these people lat@@ er.    
 So I wear two h@@ at@@ s in most of what I do.    
 As the one h@@ at, I do history of anatom@@ y.    
 I'm a hi@@ stor@@ ian by tra@@ in@@ ing, and what I study in that case is the way that people have de@@ al@@ t with anatom@@ y -- mean@@ ing human bo@@ di@@ es, ani@@ mal bodies -- how they de@@ al@@ t with bo@@ di@@ ly flu@@ id@@ s, concep@@ ts of bo@@ di@@ es@@ ; how have they thought about bo@@ di@@ es.    
 is as an ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st, as a pati@@ ent adv@@ oc@@ ate -- or, as I sometimes say, as an imp@@ ati@@ ent adv@@ oc@@ ate -- for people who are pati@@ ents of doc@@ tor@@ s.    
 In that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social nor@@ m@@ s.    
 So some of what I've worked on, for example, is people who are con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins -- two people within one bod@@ y.    
 Some of what I've worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ f@@ ism -- so people who are much shor@@ ter than ty@@ pic@@ al.    
 And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have at@@ y@@ pical sex -- so people who don't have the stand@@ ard male or the stand@@ ard fe@@ male body typ@@ es.    
 And as a gener@@ al ter@@ m, we can use the term inter@@ sex for this.    
 Inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different for@@ m@@ s.    
 that isn't stand@@ ard for male or fe@@ mal@@ e.    
 So in one instan@@ ce, you can have somebody who has an X@@ Y chromos@@ om@@ al bas@@ is, and that S@@ R@@ Y gen@@ e on the Y chromos@@ ome tel@@ ls the pro@@ to-@@ g@@ on@@ ad@@ s, which we all have in the fe@@ tal life, to become tes@@ t@@ es.    
 And so in the fe@@ tal life the tes@@ tes are pu@@ mp@@ ing out tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one.    
 But because this individual l@@ ac@@ ks rec@@ ep@@ tors to hear that tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one, the body doesn't re@@ act to the tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one.    
 And this is a syn@@ d@@ r@@ ome called an@@ dro@@ g@@ en in@@ sen@@ si@@ tiv@@ ity syn@@ d@@ rom@@ e.    
 So lots of level@@ s of tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one, but no reac@@ tion to it.    
 As a consequ@@ ence, the body develop@@ s more along the fe@@ male typical pa@@ th.    
 When the child is bor@@ n, she looks like a girl@@ .    
 She is a girl@@ . She is rais@@ ed as a girl@@ .    
 And it's often not until she h@@ its pub@@ er@@ ty and she's growing and develop@@ ing brea@@ sts, but she's not getting her peri@@ o@@ d, that somebody figu@@ res out some@@ thing@@ 's up here.    
 And they do some tes@@ ts and figure out that, instead of having o@@ v@@ ar@@ ies inside and a u@@ ter@@ us, she actually has tes@@ tes insid@@ e, and she has a Y chromos@@ om@@ e.    
 Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being mal@@ e, but they're really no@@ t.    
 F@@ em@@ al@@ es, like mal@@ es, have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lan@@ ds.    
 They're in the back of our bod@@ y.    
 And the ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lan@@ ds make an@@ dro@@ gen@@ s, which are a ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ izing hor@@ mon@@ e.    
 M@@ ost fe@@ mal@@ es like me -- I believe myself to be a typical fe@@ male -- I don't actually know my chromos@@ om@@ al ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up but I think I'm probably typical -- most fe@@ mal@@ es like me are actually an@@ dro@@ gen@@ -@@ sen@@ si@@ tive.    
 We're making an@@ dro@@ gen@@ , and we're respon@@ ding to an@@ dro@@ gen@@ s.    
 has actually had a brain ex@@ pos@@ ed to more an@@ dro@@ gen@@ s than the woman born with tes@@ tes who has an@@ dro@@ g@@ en in@@ sen@@ si@@ tiv@@ ity syn@@ d@@ rom@@ e.    
 So sex is really complic@@ at@@ ed@@ ; it's not just that inter@@ sex people in some wa@@ ys, they can be all over the plac@@ e.    
 A@@ no@@ ther examp@@ le@@ : a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 1@@ 9 years old, who was born a bo@@ y, rais@@ ed a bo@@ y, had a girl@@ fri@@ end, had sex with his girl@@ fri@@ end, had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o@@ v@@ ar@@ ies and a u@@ ter@@ us insid@@ e.    
 What he had was an ex@@ tre@@ me form of a condi@@ tion called con@@ gen@@ ital ad@@ ren@@ al hy@@ per@@ pl@@ as@@ i@@ a.    
 He had X@@ X chromos@@ om@@ es, and in the wom@@ b@@ , his ad@@ ren@@ al g@@ lan@@ ds were in such high ge@@ ar that it cre@@ ated, ess@@ enti@@ ally, a ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ine hor@@ mon@@ al environ@@ ment.    
 And as a consequ@@ ence, his gen@@ it@@ als were ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ z@@ ed, his brain was subjec@@ t to the more typical ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ine comp@@ on@@ ent of hor@@ mon@@ es.    
 And he was born looking like a boy -- no@@ body s@@ us@@ pec@@ ted any@@ thing.    
 And it was only when he had reach@@ ed the age of 1@@ 9 that he began to have enough medi@@ cal problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating inter@@ n@@ ally, that doc@@ tors figu@@ red out that, in fact, he was fe@@ male inter@@ n@@ ally.    
 Oka@@ y, so just one more quic@@ k example of a way you can have inter@@ sex@@ .    
 Some people who have X@@ X chromos@@ om@@ es de@@ vel@@ op what are called o@@ vo@@ tes@@ ti@@ s, which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tis@@ su@@ e with tes@@ tic@@ ular tis@@ su@@ e w@@ ra@@ pped around it.    
 And we're not exactly sure why that happen@@ s.    
 So sex can come in lots of different vari@@ e@@ ties.    
 that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it's d@@ war@@ f@@ ism, or it's con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ in@@ ning, or it's an inter@@ sex type -- are often normal@@ ized by sur@@ ge@@ ons is not because it actually lea@@ ves them better off in terms of physical heal@@ th.    
 In many cas@@ es, people are actually perfec@@ tly health@@ y.    
 The reason they're often subjec@@ t to vari@@ ous kinds of surg@@ er@@ ies is because they thre@@ at@@ en our social categ@@ ori@@ es.    
 that a particular kind of anatom@@ y comes with a particular identi@@ ty.    
 So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a fe@@ male identi@@ ty@@ ; what it means to be a black person is, al@@ le@@ ge@@ d@@ ly, is to have an Afri@@ can anatom@@ y in terms of your hi@@ story.    
 And so we have this terri@@ b@@ ly simp@@ li@@ sti@@ c idea@@ .    
 And when we're fac@@ ed with a body that actually pres@@ ents us something quite differ@@ ent, it star@@ t@@ les us in terms of those categor@@ iz@@ a@@ tions.    
 So we have a lot of very rom@@ an@@ tic ideas in our culture about individu@@ al@@ ism.    
 And our na@@ tion@@ 's really foun@@ ded on a very rom@@ an@@ tic concept of individu@@ al@@ ism.    
 Well you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one bod@@ y.    
 Wh@@ ere I r@@ an into the most he@@ at from this most rec@@ ently was last year the South Afri@@ can run@@ n@@ er, C@@ a@@ ster S@@ em@@ en@@ y@@ a, had her sex called into question at the Inter@@ national G@@ am@@ es in B@@ er@@ lin@@ .    
 I had a lot of jour@@ nal@@ ists call@@ ing me, asking me, "@@ Wh@@ ich is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not C@@ a@@ ster S@@ em@@ en@@ y@@ a is male or fe@@ mal@@ e@@ ?"    
 And I had to explain to the jour@@ nal@@ ists there isn't such a tes@@ t.    
 that sex is complicated enough that we have to adm@@ it nature doesn't dra@@ w the line for us between male and fe@@ mal@@ e, or between male and inter@@ sex and fe@@ male and inter@@ sex@@ ; we actually dra@@ w that line on natu@@ re.    
 So what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science go@@ es, the more we have to adm@@ it to ourselves that these categor@@ ies that we thought of as st@@ able anatom@@ ical categor@@ ies that ma@@ pped very simply are a lot more fu@@ z@@ z@@ y than we thou@@ ght.    
 And it's not just in terms of sex@@ .    
 It's also in terms of rac@@ e, which turns out to be va@@ st@@ ly more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ o@@ logy has al@@ lo@@ we@@ d.    
 As we loo@@ k, we get into all sorts of un@@ comfor@@ table are@@ as@@ .    
 We loo@@ k, for example, about the fact that we share at least 9@@ 5 percent of our DN@@ A with ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es.    
 What are we to make of the fact that we di@@ ff@@ er from them only really by a few nuc@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ des@@ ?    
 And as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our sci@@ ence, we get more and more into a dis@@ comfor@@ ted z@@ one where we have to ac@@ knowledge that the simp@@ li@@ sti@@ c categor@@ ies we've had are probably over@@ ly simp@@ li@@ s@@ tic.    
 So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life.    
 in our culture today, in the United States today, is b@@ att@@ les over the beginning of life and the end of life.    
 We have difficult conversa@@ tions about at what point we dec@@ ide a body becomes a human@@ , such that it has a different right than a fe@@ tal life.    
 We have very difficult conversa@@ tions no@@ wa@@ days -- about the question of when some@@ bod@@ y's dea@@ d.    
 In the pa@@ st, our anc@@ es@@ tors never had to stru@@ gg@@ le so much with this question of when somebody was dea@@ d.    
 At mo@@ st, they@@ 'd s@@ tic@@ k a fe@@ a@@ ther on some@@ bod@@ y's no@@ se, and if it t@@ wit@@ ch@@ ed, they didn't bur@@ y them ye@@ t.    
 If it stopped t@@ wit@@ ch@@ ing, you bur@@ y them.    
 But today, we have a situation where we want to take v@@ ital org@@ ans out of be@@ ings and give them to other be@@ ings.    
 And as a consequ@@ ence, we're st@@ uc@@ k with having to stru@@ gg@@ le with this really difficult question about who's dea@@ d, and this lead@@ s us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple categor@@ ies as we've had before.    
 Now you might think that all this brea@@ k@@ ing@@ -@@ down of categor@@ ies would make somebody like me really happ@@ y.    
 I'm a political progres@@ si@@ ve, I def@@ end people with un@@ usu@@ al bo@@ di@@ es, but I have to adm@@ it to you that it makes me ner@@ v@@ ous.    
 Un@@ der@@ standing that these categor@@ ies are really much more un@@ st@@ able than we thought makes me ten@@ se.    
 from the point of view of thinking about demo@@ crac@@ y.    
 So in order to tell you about that ten@@ sion, I have to first adm@@ it to you that I'm a huge f@@ an of the F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ a@@ ther@@ s.    
 I know they were rac@@ ist@@ s, I know they were sex@@ ist@@ , but they were great@@ .    
 I mean, they were so bra@@ ve and so bo@@ ld and so radi@@ cal in what they did that I find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y mus@@ ical "@@ 1@@ 7@@ 7@@ 6@@ " every few years, and it's not because of the mus@@ ic, which is totally for@@ ge@@ t@@ tab@@ le.    
 It's because of what happened in 1@@ 7@@ 7@@ 6 with the F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ a@@ ther@@ s.    
 The F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ a@@ ther@@ s wer@@ e, for my point of view@@ , the or@@ ig@@ in@@ al anatom@@ ical ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts, and this is wh@@ y.    
 What they re@@ jec@@ ted was an anatom@@ ical concept and re@@ plac@@ ed it with another one that was radi@@ cal and beautiful and hel@@ d us for 2@@ 00 years.    
 So as you all rec@@ all, what our F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ a@@ ther@@ s were re@@ jec@@ ting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y, and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simp@@ li@@ sti@@ c concept of anatom@@ y.    
 The mon@@ arch@@ s of the old world didn't have a concept of DN@@ A@@ , but they did have a concept of bir@@ th@@ right.    
 They had a concept of bl@@ ue bloo@@ d.    
 They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being pas@@ sed down from grand@@ father to father to son and so for@@ th.    
 The F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ a@@ ther@@ s re@@ jec@@ ted that idea@@ , and they re@@ plac@@ ed it with a new anatom@@ ical concep@@ t, and that concept was all men are created equ@@ al.    
 They level@@ ed that playing fiel@@ d and decided the anatom@@ y that mat@@ tered was the com@@ mon@@ ality of anatom@@ y, not the difference in anatom@@ y, and that was a really radi@@ cal thing to do.    
 because they were part of an En@@ light@@ en@@ ment system where two things were growing up together.    
 And that was demo@@ crac@@ y growing up, but it was also science growing up at the same time.    
 And it's really c@@ lear@@ , if you look at the history of the F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ a@@ ther@@ s, a lot of them were very interested in sci@@ ence, and they were interested in a concept of a n@@ atur@@ al@@ istic world.    
 They were moving away from super@@ natural ex@@ plan@@ a@@ tions, and they were re@@ jec@@ ting things like a super@@ natural concept of pow@@ er, where it tran@@ sm@@ it@@ ted because of a very v@@ ag@@ ue concept of bir@@ th@@ right.    
 They were moving towards a n@@ atur@@ al@@ istic concep@@ t.    
 And if you loo@@ k, for example, in the D@@ ec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ dep@@ end@@ ence, they talk about nature and natu@@ re@@ 's Go@@ d.    
 They don't talk about G@@ od and Go@@ d@@ 's natu@@ re.    
 They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are.    
 So as part of that, they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatom@@ ical com@@ mon@@ al@@ ity.    
 the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l Ri@@ ghts mov@@ ement of the fu@@ ture.    
 They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great@@ .    
 So what happened years af@@ ter@@ war@@ d?    
 What happened was wom@@ en, for example, who wanted the right to vo@@ t@@ e, took the F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ a@@ ther@@ s' concept of anatom@@ ical com@@ mon@@ ality being more important than anatom@@ ical difference and said, "The fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ v@@ ar@@ ies to mean that we sh@@ ouldn't have the right to vo@@ t@@ e, the right to full citi@@ zen@@ shi@@ p, the right to own proper@@ ty, et@@ c@@ .@@ , et@@ c@@ ."    
 And women success@@ fully argu@@ ed that.    
 N@@ ext came the success@@ ful C@@ i@@ vi@@ l Ri@@ ghts mov@@ em@@ ent, talking ab@@ out, "A@@ in@@ 't I a wom@@ an@@ ?"    
 on the mar@@ ching lin@@ es of the C@@ i@@ vi@@ l Ri@@ ghts mov@@ ement say@@ ing, "I am a man@@ ."    
 A@@ g@@ ain@@ , people of color appe@@ al@@ ing to a com@@ mon@@ ality of anatom@@ y over a difference of anatom@@ y, again, success@@ ful@@ ly.    
 We see the same thing with the dis@@ ability rights mov@@ em@@ ent.    
 The problem is, of course, that, as we begin to look at all that com@@ mon@@ al@@ ity, we have to begin to question why we main@@ tain certain di@@ vi@@ sion@@ s.    
 Now mind you, I want to main@@ tain some di@@ vi@@ sion@@ s, anatom@@ ic@@ ally, in our cul@@ ture.    
 For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human@@ .    
 I don't want to say we give up enti@@ rely on anatom@@ y.    
 I don't want to say fi@@ ve@@ -year-@@ ol@@ ds should be allow@@ ed to con@@ sent to sex or con@@ sent to mar@@ r@@ y.    
 So there are some anatom@@ ical di@@ vi@@ sions that make sense to me and that I think we should re@@ tain@@ .    
 and why do we re@@ tain them and do they have mean@@ ing.    
 So let's go back to those two be@@ ings con@@ c@@ ei@@ ved at the beginning of this tal@@ k.    
 We have two be@@ ings, both con@@ c@@ ei@@ ved in the middle of 19@@ 7@@ 9 on the ex@@ act same day.    
 Let's imagine one of them, M@@ ar@@ y, is born three months pre@@ mat@@ u@@ re@@ ly, so she's born on J@@ un@@ e 1, 19@@ 80@@ .    
 H@@ en@@ r@@ y, by con@@ tra@@ st, is born at ter@@ m, so he's born on M@@ arch 1, 19@@ 80@@ .    
 S@@ imp@@ ly by virtu@@ e of the fact that M@@ ary was born pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely three month@@ s, she comes into all sorts of rights three months earli@@ er than H@@ en@@ ry does -- the right to con@@ sent to sex@@ , the right to vo@@ t@@ e, the right to d@@ rin@@ k.    
 H@@ en@@ ry has to wa@@ it for all of that, not because he's actually any different in age, bio@@ log@@ ic@@ ally, excep@@ t in terms of when he was bor@@ n.    
 We find other kinds of we@@ ir@@ d@@ ness in terms of what their rights are.    
 H@@ en@@ r@@ y, by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male -- al@@ though I haven't told you that he's the X@@ Y one -- by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male is now li@@ able to be dra@@ f@@ ted, which M@@ ary does not need to wor@@ ry ab@@ out.    
 M@@ ar@@ y, mean@@ whi@@ le, cannot in all the st@@ ates have the same right that H@@ en@@ ry has in all the st@@ ates, nam@@ ely, the right to mar@@ r@@ y.    
 H@@ en@@ ry can mar@@ ry in every state a wom@@ an, but M@@ ary can only mar@@ ry today in a few st@@ ates a wom@@ an.    
 So we have these anatom@@ ical categor@@ ies that per@@ si@@ st that are in many ways proble@@ ma@@ tic and ques@@ tion@@ able.    
 And the question to me be@@ com@@ es@@ : What do we do, in looking at anatom@@ y, that a demo@@ crac@@ y that's been based on anatom@@ y might start f@@ all@@ ing a@@ part@@ ?    
 I don't want to give up the sci@@ ence, but at the same time it kind of feel@@ s sometimes like the science is coming out from under us.    
 So where do we go@@ ?    
 It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of p@@ ra@@ g@@ ma@@ tic at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de@@ : "Well, we have to dra@@ w the line some@@ wher@@ e, so we will dra@@ w the line some@@ wher@@ e."    
 But a lot of people get st@@ uc@@ k in a very str@@ ange posi@@ tion.    
 T@@ ex@@ as has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry a man is to mean that you don't have a Y chromos@@ om@@ e, and what it means to mar@@ ry a woman means you do have a Y chromos@@ om@@ e.    
 Now in prac@@ tice they don't actually test people for their chromos@@ om@@ es.    
 But this is also very bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re, because of the story I told you at the beginning about an@@ dro@@ g@@ en in@@ sen@@ si@@ tiv@@ ity syn@@ d@@ rom@@ e.    
 If we look at one of the foun@@ ding father@@ s of moder@@ n demo@@ crac@@ y, D@@ r. M@@ arti@@ n L@@ u@@ ther K@@ ing, he offer@@ s us something of a solu@@ tion in his "I have a dre@@ am@@ " spe@@ e@@ ch.    
 He says we should judge people "@@ based not on the color of their sk@@ in, moving beyond anatom@@ y.    
 And I want to say, "@@ Yea@@ h, that soun@@ ds like a really good idea@@ ."    
 But in prac@@ tic@@ e, how do you do it?    
 How do you judge people based on the cont@@ ent of charac@@ ter@@ ?    
 I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te rights in terms of human@@ s, be@@ cause, I have to adm@@ it, that there are some go@@ l@@ d@@ en re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s I know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some human@@ s I know.    
 I also want to say there are probably also some y@@ el@@ low L@@ ab@@ ra@@ d@@ ors that I know that are more cap@@ able of infor@@ me@@ d, intellig@@ ent, mat@@ ure decisions about sex@@ u@@ al rela@@ tions than some 4@@ 0@@ -year-@@ ol@@ ds that I know.    
 So how do we oper@@ a@@ tion@@ al@@ ize the question of cont@@ ent of charac@@ ter@@ ?    
 It turns out to be really diffic@@ ul@@ t.    
 And part of me also wonder@@ s, what if cont@@ ent of charac@@ ter turns out to be something that's s@@ can@@ n@@ able in the future -- able to be seen with an f@@ M@@ R@@ I@@ ?    
 Do we really want to go ther@@ e?    
 I'm not sure where we go.    
 What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the le@@ ad of thinking about this issu@@ e of demo@@ crac@@ y.    
 We've done a really good job stru@@ gg@@ ling with demo@@ crac@@ y, and I think we would do a good job in the fu@@ ture.    
 We don't have a situation that I@@ r@@ an ha@@ s, for example, where a man who's sex@@ u@@ ally at@@ trac@@ ted to other men is li@@ able to be m@@ ur@@ der@@ ed, un@@ less he's willing to sub@@ m@@ it to a sex chang@@ e, in which case he's allow@@ ed to liv@@ e.    
 We don't have that kind of situ@@ ation.    
 a sur@@ ge@@ on I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins in order to se@@ par@@ ate them, par@@ tly to make a name for hi@@ m@@ self.    
 But when I was on the phone with him, asking why he was going to do this surg@@ ery -- this was a very high@@ -@@ ris@@ k surg@@ ery -- his answer was that, in this other na@@ tion, these children were going to be tre@@ ated very b@@ ad@@ ly, and so he had to do this.    
 My respon@@ se to him was, "Well, have you consid@@ ered political as@@ y@@ l@@ um instead of a se@@ par@@ ation surg@@ er@@ y@@ ?"    
 The United States has offer@@ ed trem@@ end@@ ous possib@@ ility for allow@@ ing people to be the way they are, without having them have to be changed for the sa@@ ke of the st@@ ate.    
 So I think we have to be in the lea@@ d.    
 Well, just to clo@@ se, I want to sugg@@ est to you that I've been talking a lot about the father@@ s.    
 And I want to think about the possibili@@ ties of what demo@@ crac@@ y might look like, or might have looked like, if we had more invol@@ ved the mother@@ s.    
 And I want to say something a little bit radi@@ cal for a femin@@ ist@@ , and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of in@@ si@@ ghts that can come from different kinds of anatom@@ ies, particularly when we have people thinking in grou@@ p@@ s.    
 Now for years, because I've been interested in inter@@ sex@@ , I've also been interested in sex difference rese@@ arch@@ .    
 And one of the things that I've been really interested in in terms of the way they think and oper@@ ate in the world.    
 And what we know from c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ cul@@ tural stu@@ dies is that fe@@ mal@@ es, on average -- not every@@ one, but on average -- are more incl@@ ined to be very att@@ enti@@ ve to complex social rela@@ tions and to taking care of people who are basically vul@@ ner@@ able within the grou@@ p.    
 And so if we think about that, we have an interesting situation on our han@@ ds.    
 Y@@ ear@@ s ago, when I was in gradu@@ ate school, one of my gradu@@ ate adv@@ is@@ ers who knew I was interested in femin@@ ism -- I consid@@ ered myself a femin@@ ist@@ , as I still do -- asked a really str@@ ange ques@@ tion.    
 He said, "@@ T@@ ell me what's femin@@ ine about femin@@ is@@ m@@ ."    
 And I thought, "@@ Well that's the du@@ mb@@ est question I've ever hear@@ d.    
 F@@ em@@ in@@ ism is all about un@@ doing ster@@ e@@ o@@ types about gen@@ d@@ er, so there's nothing femin@@ ine about femin@@ is@@ m@@ ."    
 But the more I thought about his ques@@ tion, the more I thought there might be something femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism.    
 That is to say, there might be some@@ thing, on aver@@ age, different about fe@@ male bra@@ ins from male bra@@ ins that makes us more att@@ enti@@ ve to deep@@ ly complex social relationshi@@ ps and more att@@ enti@@ ve to taking care of the vul@@ ner@@ able.    
 So wher@@ e@@ as the father@@ s were ex@@ trem@@ ely att@@ enti@@ ve to fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing out how to prote@@ ct individu@@ als from the st@@ at@@ e, it's possible that if we in@@ jec@@ ted more mother@@ s into this concep@@ t, what we would have is more of a concept of, not just how to prote@@ c@@ t, but how to care for each other.    
 And maybe that's where we need to go in the fu@@ ture, when we take demo@@ crac@@ y beyond anatom@@ y, is to think less about the individual bod@@ y, in terms of the identi@@ ty, and think more about those relationshi@@ p@@ s.    
 So that as we the people try to create a more perfect uni@@ on, we're thinking about what we do for each other.    
 Thank you.    
 In 200@@ 7@@ , I decided that we needed to re@@ concep@@ tu@@ al@@ ize how we thought about econom@@ ic develop@@ ment.    
 Our new goal should be that when every family thin@@ ks about where they want to live and work, they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were all compe@@ ting to at@@ tr@@ act new resid@@ ents.    
 Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.    
 There are billi@@ ons of people in develop@@ ing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to w@@ el@@ come them.    
 But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it co@@ sts to build them.    
 So we could eas@@ ily supp@@ ly the world with do@@ zen@@ s, maybe hundre@@ ds, of new ci@@ ties.    
 Now this might sound pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous to you if you've never thought about new ci@@ ties.    
 But just sub@@ stitu@@ te a@@ partment building for ci@@ ties.    
 I@@ mag@@ ine half the people who wanted to be in a@@ part@@ ments already had them@@ ; the other half aren't there ye@@ t.    
 You could try and exp@@ and the cap@@ ac@@ ity by doing ad@@ di@@ tions on all the exist@@ ing a@@ part@@ ment@@ s.    
 But you know what you'd run into is those a@@ part@@ ments and the sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ding are@@ as have rul@@ es to a@@ vo@@ id dis@@ comfor@@ t and the di@@ str@@ ac@@ tions of construc@@ tion.    
 So it's ex@@ trem@@ ely hard to do all of those ad@@ di@@ tions.    
 But you could go out some@@ place brand new@@ , build a brand new a@@ partment build@@ ing, as long as the rul@@ es there were ones that fac@@ il@@ it@@ ated construc@@ tion rather than getting in the way.    
 So I pro@@ pos@@ ed that govern@@ ments create new re@@ form z@@ ones big enough to hold cities and gave them a nam@@ e: char@@ ter ci@@ ties.    
 L@@ at@@ er I learned that at about this same time, J@@ a@@ vi@@ er and O@@ c@@ ta@@ vi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as@@ .    
 They knew that about 7@@ 5@@ ,000 H@@ on@@ dur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the United St@@ ates, and they wanted to as@@ k, what could they do to make sure that those people could sta@@ y and do the same things in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as@@ .    
 At one poin@@ t, J@@ a@@ vi@@ er said to O@@ c@@ ta@@ vi@@ o, "What if we took some of our emp@@ ty land -- what if we just gave it to an em@@ bas@@ s@@ y -- give some to the U.S. em@@ bas@@ sy@@ ; give some to the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an em@@ bas@@ s@@ y -- and then if people want to go work under the rul@@ es of C@@ an@@ ad@@ a or under the rul@@ es of the United St@@ ates, they can go get job@@ s, do everything they do on those em@@ bas@@ s@@ y grou@@ n@@ ds    
 that they would other@@ w@@ ise have to go to C@@ an@@ ad@@ a or the U.S. to do@@ ?"    
 In the sum@@ m@@ er of 200@@ 9@@ , H@@ on@@ dur@@ as went through a w@@ ren@@ ching con@@ stitu@@ tional cri@@ si@@ s.    
 At the next re@@ g@@ ul@@ arly sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed elec@@ tion, P@@ ep@@ e L@@ ob@@ o w@@ on in a lan@@ d@@ sli@@ de on a pl@@ at@@ form that prom@@ is@@ ed re@@ for@@ m, but re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation as well.    
 He asked O@@ c@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to be his chi@@ ef of sta@@ ff@@ .    
 M@@ e@@ an@@ whi@@ le, I was getting ready to give a talk at TED@@ G@@ lo@@ b@@ al.    
 Th@@ rou@@ gh a process of re@@ fin@@ em@@ ent, tri@@ al and er@@ r@@ or, a lot of us@@ er tes@@ ting, I tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of char@@ ter city down to the b@@ are ess@@ enti@@ als.    
 The first point was the import@@ ance of rul@@ es, like those rul@@ es that say you can't come in and dist@@ ur@@ b all the exist@@ ing a@@ partment hol@@ der@@ s.    
 We pa@@ y a lot of att@@ ention to new technologi@@ es, but it takes technologi@@ es and rul@@ es to get progres@@ s, and it's usually the rul@@ es that hold us back.    
 In the f@@ all of 20@@ 10@@ , a friend from G@@ u@@ at@@ em@@ al@@ a sent O@@ c@@ ta@@ vi@@ o a lin@@ k to the TED@@ T@@ al@@ k.    
 He show@@ ed it to J@@ a@@ vi@@ er.    
 They called me.    
 They said, "@@ Let's present this to the lead@@ ers of our countr@@ y."    
 So in D@@ ec@@ em@@ b@@ er we met in Mi@@ am@@ i@@ , in a ho@@ te@@ l conf@@ er@@ ence room.    
 I tried to explain this point about how valu@@ able cities are, how much more valu@@ able they are than they co@@ st.    
 And I used this sli@@ de showing how valu@@ able the ra@@ w land is in a place like New York C@@ it@@ y@@ : no@@ tic@@ e, land that's worth thousands of dollar@@ s, in some cas@@ es, per squ@@ are me@@ ter.    
 But it was a fa@@ ir@@ ly ab@@ str@@ act disc@@ us@@ sion, and at some point when there was a pa@@ us@@ e, O@@ c@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said, "@@ P@@ a@@ ul@@ , maybe we could watch the TED@@ T@@ al@@ k@@ ."    
   So the TED@@ T@@ al@@ k la@@ id out in very simple ter@@ ms, a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited lan@@ d, a char@@ ter that speci@@ fi@@ es the rul@@ es that will app@@ ly there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in, to go live under those rul@@ es or no@@ t.    
 So I was asked by the pres@@ id@@ ent of H@@ on@@ dur@@ as who said that we need to do this projec@@ t, this could be the way forward for our countr@@ y.    
 I was asked to come to T@@ e@@ gu@@ ci@@ g@@ al@@ p@@ a and talk again on J@@ an@@ u@@ ary four@@ th and fi@@ f@@ th.    
 So I present@@ ed another fac@@ t@@ -@@ f@@ ill@@ ed lec@@ ture that inclu@@ ded a sli@@ de like this, which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a c@@ ity, it has to be very bi@@ g@@ .    
 This is a picture of D@@ en@@ ver, and the out@@ line is the new air@@ por@@ t that was built in D@@ en@@ ver.    
 This air@@ por@@ t alone cover@@ s more than 100 squ@@ are k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters.    
 if you build a new c@@ ity, you've got to start with a s@@ ite that's at least 1@@ ,000 squ@@ are k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters.    
 That's more than 2@@ 50 hundre@@ d-@@ thous@@ and ac@@ re@@ s.    
 Every@@ body app@@ la@@ u@@ ded pol@@ it@@ el@@ y.    
 The fac@@ es in the audi@@ ence were very seri@@ ous and att@@ enti@@ ve.    
 The lead@@ er of the con@@ gres@@ s came up on st@@ age and said, "@@ P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or R@@ om@@ er, th@@ ank you very much for your lec@@ ture, but maybe we could watch the TED@@ T@@ al@@ k.    
 I've got it here on my la@@ p@@ top@@ ."    
 So I s@@ at dow@@ n, and they play@@ ed the TED@@ T@@ al@@ k.    
 And it got to the ess@@ ence, which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.    
 There would be a choice of a city which you could go to instead of hundreds of miles away in the Nor@@ th.    
 And it also invol@@ ved new choices for lead@@ ers.    
 Because the lead@@ ers in the government there in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as would need help from part@@ ner countri@@ es, who could bene@@ fit from part@@ ner countries who help them set up the rul@@ es in this char@@ ter and the en@@ forc@@ em@@ ent, so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will be en@@ forc@@ ed.    
 And the in@@ si@@ ght of Presid@@ ent L@@ ob@@ o was that that as@@ su@@ ran@@ ce of en@@ forc@@ ement that I was thinking about as a way to get the fore@@ ign inv@@ es@@ tors to come in and build the city could be equ@@ ally important for all the different par@@ ties in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as who had suffer@@ ed for so many years from fe@@ ar and di@@ stru@@ st.    
 We went and looked at a sit@@ e.    
 This pic@@ ture@@ 's from there.    
 It eas@@ ily could hold a thous@@ and squ@@ are k@@ il@@ ome@@ ters.    
 And sh@@ ort@@ ly ther@@ ea@@ f@@ ter, on J@@ an@@ u@@ ary 19@@ th, they vo@@ ted in the con@@ gres@@ s to am@@ end their con@@ stitu@@ tion to have a con@@ stitu@@ tional pro@@ vi@@ sion that allow@@ s for speci@@ al development re@@ gi@@ on@@ s.    
 In a country which had just gone through this w@@ ren@@ ching cri@@ si@@ s, the vo@@ te in the con@@ gres@@ s in fa@@ v@@ or of this con@@ stitu@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment was 1@@ 2@@ 4 to one.    
 All par@@ ties, all fac@@ tions in societ@@ y, bac@@ ked this.    
 To be part of the con@@ stitu@@ tion, you actually have to pas@@ s it tw@@ ice in the con@@ gres@@ s.    
 On F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ary 1@@ 7@@ th they pas@@ sed it again with another vo@@ te of 1@@ 1@@ 4 to one.    
 I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately after that vo@@ t@@ e, on F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ary 2@@ 1@@ st to the 2@@ 4@@ th, a del@@ eg@@ ation of about 30 H@@ on@@ dur@@ ans that are most interested in getting into the city building busin@@ ess.    
 One is South K@@ o@@ rea@@ .    
 This is a picture of a bi@@ g, new city cent@@ er that's being built in South Kore@@ a -- bigg@@ er than down@@ town B@@ o@@ st@@ on.    
 Every@@ thing you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the per@@ m@@ it@@ s.    
 The other place that's very interested in city building is S@@ ing@@ a@@ po@@ re.    
 The@@ y@@ 've actually built two cities already in Chin@@ a and are pre@@ par@@ ing the th@@ ir@@ d.    
 So if you think about this prac@@ tic@@ ally, here's where we are.    
 The@@ y@@ 've got a sit@@ e@@ ; they're already thinking about this s@@ ite for the second city.    
 They're putting in place a leg@@ al system that could allow for manag@@ ers to come in, and also an ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al leg@@ al system.    
 One country has already volunte@@ ered to let its su@@ pre@@ me cour@@ t be the cour@@ t of fin@@ al appe@@ al for the new ju@@ di@@ ci@@ al system there.    
 There's desig@@ n@@ ers and build@@ ers of cities who are very interes@@ ted.    
 They even can bring with them some fin@@ anc@@ ing.    
 But the one thing you know they@@ 've already sol@@ ved is that there's lots of ten@@ an@@ ts.    
 There's lots of busin@@ ess@@ es that would like to loc@@ ate in the Ameri@@ ca@@ s, especially in a place with a free tra@@ de z@@ one, and there's lots of people who@@ 'd like to go there.    
 A@@ rou@@ nd the world, there's 7@@ 00 million people who say they@@ 'd like to move per@@ man@@ ently some@@ place else right now.    
 There's a million a year who leave L@@ ati@@ n Americ@@ a to go to the United St@@ at@@ es.    
 M@@ any of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- who has to get enough money to even pa@@ y for food or clo@@ thing.    
 S@@ ad@@ ly, sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ un@@ ited with their parents that they haven't se@@ en, in some cas@@ es, for a deca@@ de.    
 So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as@@ ?    
 Or to build a do@@ z@@ en of thes@@ e, or a hundred of thes@@ e, around the worl@@ d?    
 What kind of an idea is it to think about in@@ sist@@ ing that every family have a choice of several cities that are compe@@ ting to at@@ tr@@ act new resid@@ ent@@ s?    
 This is an idea worth sp@@ read@@ ing.    
 And my friends from H@@ on@@ dur@@ as asked me to say th@@ ank you, TED@@ .    
 I'm J@@ es@@ si@@ , and this is my su@@ it@@ ca@@ se.    
 But before I show you what I've got insid@@ e, I'm going to make a very public conf@@ es@@ sion, and that is, I'm out@@ f@@ it@@ -@@ ob@@ ses@@ se@@ d.    
 I love fin@@ d@@ ing, we@@ ar@@ ing, and more rec@@ ent@@ ly, photograph@@ ing and b@@ log@@ g@@ ing a differ@@ ent, color@@ ful, crazy out@@ fit for every single oc@@ ca@@ sion.    
 But I don't buy anything new@@ .    
 I get all my clo@@ the@@ s secon@@ d@@ hand from f@@ le@@ a marke@@ ts and th@@ ri@@ ft store@@ s.    
 A@@ w@@ w@@ , th@@ ank you.    
 S@@ econ@@ d@@ hand shop@@ ping allow@@ s me to re@@ duce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my wal@@ le@@ t.    
 I get to meet all kinds of great people@@ ; my dollars usually go to a good caus@@ e@@ ; I look pretty uniqu@@ e@@ ; and it makes shop@@ ping like my own person@@ al tre@@ as@@ ure hun@@ t.    
 I mean, what am I going to find to@@ da@@ y?    
 Is it going to be my si@@ z@@ e?    
 W@@ ill I like the color@@ ?    
 W@@ ill it be under $@@ 20@@ ?    
 If all the answ@@ ers are y@@ es, I feel as though I've w@@ on.    
 I want to get back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what I pac@@ ked for this exc@@ iting week here at TED@@ .    
 I mean, what does somebody with all these out@@ f@@ its bring with her@@ ?    
 So I'm going to show you exactly what I b@@ rou@@ ght.    
 I brought seven pa@@ ir@@ s of under@@ pan@@ ts and that's it.    
 E@@ x@@ ac@@ tly one wee@@ k@@ 's worth of un@@ dies is all I put in my su@@ it@@ ca@@ se.    
 I was bet@@ ting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to P@@ al@@ m S@@ p@@ r@@ ings.    
 And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her under@@ wear -- that means I found a few things.    
 And I'd really love to show you my wee@@ k@@ 's worth of out@@ f@@ its right now.    
 Do@@ es that sound goo@@ d?    
   So as I do this, I'm also going to tell you a few of the life less@@ ons in these ad@@ ven@@ tures we@@ aring nothing new@@ .    
 So let's start with S@@ un@@ day.    
 I call this "@@ Sh@@ in@@ y T@@ ig@@ er@@ ."    
 You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great@@ .    
 You can almost always look ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al for under $@@ 5@@ 0@@ .    
 This whole out@@ f@@ it, including the j@@ ac@@ ke@@ t, cost me $@@ 5@@ 5@@ , and it was the most exp@@ en@@ sive thing that I wor@@ e the entire wee@@ k.    
 M@@ on@@ day@@ : C@@ ol@@ or is power@@ ful.    
 to be in a bad mo@@ od when you're we@@ aring b@@ right red pan@@ ts.    
   If you are happ@@ y, you are going to at@@ tr@@ act other happy people to you.    
 T@@ u@@ es@@ day@@ : F@@ it@@ ting in is way over@@ r@@ ated.    
 I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.    
 Just be who you are.    
 If you are sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ding your@@ self with the right people, they will not only get it, they will app@@ reci@@ ate it.    
 W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day@@ : E@@ mb@@ rac@@ e your inner chil@@ d.    
 Some@@ times people tell me that I look like I'm playing dres@@ s@@ -@@ up, or that I re@@ mind them of their se@@ ven@@ -year-@@ ol@@ d.    
 I like to s@@ mi@@ le and say, "@@ Thank you@@ ."    
 Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day@@ : Con@@ f@@ idence is ke@@ y.    
 If you think you look good in some@@ thing, you almost certainly do.    
 And if you don't think you look good in some@@ thing, you're also probably right.    
 I grew up with a mo@@ m who taught me this day@@ -@@ in and day@@ -@@ out.    
 But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got what this mean@@ t.    
 And I'm going to break it down for you for just a secon@@ d.    
 If you believe you're a beautiful person there is no look that you can't pul@@ l off.    
 So there is no exc@@ use for any of us here in this audi@@ ence.    
 We should be able to ro@@ ck anything we want to ro@@ c@@ k.    
 Thank you.    
   Fri@@ day@@ : A uni@@ vers@@ al truth -- five words for you@@ : G@@ old sequ@@ ins go with every@@ thing.    
 And finally, S@@ atur@@ day@@ : D@@ ev@@ el@@ op@@ ing your own unique person@@ al st@@ y@@ le without having to say a wor@@ d.    
 It's been pro@@ ven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm we@@ ar@@ ing, and we've had great conversa@@ tions.    
 So obvi@@ ously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny su@@ it@@ ca@@ se.    
 So before I go home to B@@ roo@@ k@@ ly@@ n, I'm going to don@@ ate everything back.    
 Because the less@@ on I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's oka@@ y to let go.    
 I don't need to get emo@@ tion@@ ally att@@ ach@@ ed to these things because around the cor@@ n@@ er, there is always going to be another craz@@ y, color@@ ful, sh@@ in@@ y out@@ fit just wa@@ iting for me, if I put a little love in my heart and loo@@ k.    
 Thank you very much.    
   Thank you.    
 This is a represent@@ ation of your bra@@ in, and your brain can be bro@@ ken into two par@@ ts.    
 There's the left hal@@ f@@ , which is the logical sid@@ e, and then the right hal@@ f@@ , which is the intui@@ tive.    
 And so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ de of each h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ er@@ e, then we can p@@ lot our bra@@ in.    
 And for example, this would be somebody who's completely log@@ ic@@ al.    
 This would be someone who's enti@@ rely intui@@ tive.    
 So where would you put your brain on this scal@@ e?    
 Some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these ex@@ trem@@ es, but I think for most people in the audi@@ ence, your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ de in both h@@ em@@ is@@ ph@@ er@@ es at the same time.    
 It's not like they're mu@@ tu@@ ally ex@@ cl@@ usi@@ ve or any@@ thing.    
 You can be logical and intui@@ tive.    
 And so I consid@@ er myself one of these people, along with most of the other experi@@ mental quan@@ tu@@ m physic@@ ist@@ s, who need a good deal of logi@@ c to str@@ ing together these complex ide@@ as@@ .    
 But at the same time, we need a good deal of intui@@ tion to actually make the experi@@ ments work.    
 How do we de@@ vel@@ op this intui@@ tion@@ ? Well we like to play with stuff@@ .    
 So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it ac@@ ts, and then we de@@ vel@@ op our intui@@ tion from there.    
 And really you do the same thing.    
 So some intui@@ tion that you may have develop@@ ed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time.    
 I mean, it can sound we@@ ird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this no@@ tion, you develop@@ ed it.    
 And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop@@ .    
 He was just a to@@ dd@@ l@@ er and he wasn't very good at it, and he k@@ ept f@@ all@@ ing over@@ .    
 But I be@@ t playing with this car stop taught him a really valu@@ able less@@ on, and that's that large things don't let you get right past them, and that they sta@@ y in one plac@@ e.    
 And so this is a great concep@@ tu@@ al model to have of the world, un@@ less you're a partic@@ le physic@@ ist@@ .    
 I@@ t@@ 'd be a terri@@ ble model for a partic@@ le physic@@ ist@@ , because they don't play with car stop@@ s, they play with these little we@@ ird partic@@ les.    
 And when they play with their partic@@ l@@ es, they find they do all sorts of really we@@ ird things -- like they can f@@ ly right through w@@ all@@ s, or they can be in two different places at the same time.    
 And so they wrote down all these ob@@ ser@@ va@@ tions, and they called it the theor@@ y of quan@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ic@@ s.    
 And so that's where physic@@ s was at a few years ago@@ ; to descri@@ be litt@@ le, tiny partic@@ les.    
 But you didn't need it to descri@@ be the larg@@ e, every@@ day objec@@ ts around us.    
 This didn't really s@@ it well with my intui@@ tion, and maybe it's just because I don't play with partic@@ les very of@@ t@@ en.    
 Well, I play with them some@@ times, but not very of@@ t@@ en.    
 And I've never seen them.    
 I mean, no@@ bod@@ y's ever seen a partic@@ le.    
 But it didn't s@@ it well with my logical side ei@@ ther@@ .    
 Because if everything is made up of little partic@@ les and all the little partic@@ les follow quan@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ic@@ s, then sh@@ ouldn't everything just follow quan@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ic@@ s?    
 I don't see any reason why it sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n'@@ t.    
 if we could some@@ how show that an every@@ day objec@@ t also follow@@ s quan@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ic@@ s.    
 So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.    
 So I made one.    
 This is the first objec@@ t that has been in a mechan@@ ical quan@@ tu@@ m super@@ posi@@ tion.    
 So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chi@@ p.    
 And you can sort of see this gre@@ en do@@ t right in the m@@ idd@@ le.    
 And that's this piece of me@@ tal I'm going to be talking about in a minut@@ e.    
 This is a photo@@ gra@@ p@@ h of the objec@@ t.    
 And here I'll z@@ oo@@ m in a little b@@ it. We're looking right there in the cent@@ er.    
 And then here's a re@@ ally, really big close@@ -@@ up of the little piece of me@@ tal@@ .    
 So what we're looking at is a little ch@@ un@@ k of me@@ tal@@ , and it's sha@@ ped like a di@@ ving bo@@ ar@@ d, and it's s@@ tic@@ king out over a le@@ dg@@ e.    
 And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chi@@ p.    
 I went into a clean room with a f@@ res@@ h si@@ lic@@ on wa@@ f@@ er, and then I just c@@ ran@@ ked away at all the big mach@@ ines for about 100 hour@@ s.    
 For the last stuff@@ , I had to build my own machine -- to make this s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing po@@ ol@@ -@@ sha@@ ped ho@@ le under@@ ne@@ ath the de@@ vic@@ e.    
 This de@@ vice has the ability to be in a quan@@ tu@@ m super@@ posi@@ tion, but it needs a little help to do it.    
 H@@ er@@ e, let me give you an an@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ y.    
 You know how un@@ comfor@@ table it is to be in a c@@ row@@ ded el@@ ev@@ ator@@ ?    
 I mean, when I'm in an el@@ ev@@ at@@ or all al@@ one, I do all sorts of we@@ ird things, but then other people get on bo@@ ard and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bo@@ ther them, or, f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly, sc@@ are them.    
 So quan@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ics says that in@@ anim@@ ate objec@@ ts feel the same way.    
 The fel@@ low pas@@ sen@@ g@@ ers for in@@ anim@@ ate objec@@ ts are not just people, but it's also the light sh@@ ining on it and the w@@ ind b@@ low@@ ing past it and the he@@ at of the room.    
 And so we k@@ new@@ , if we wanted to see this piece of me@@ tal be@@ have quan@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ic@@ ally, we're going to have to k@@ ic@@ k out all the other pas@@ sen@@ g@@ ers.    
 And so that's what we di@@ d.    
 We turned off the light@@ s, and then we put it in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um and su@@ c@@ ked out all the air@@ , to just a f@@ rac@@ tion of a degre@@ e abo@@ ve absolu@@ te zer@@ o.    
 Now, all alone in the el@@ ev@@ at@@ or, the little ch@@ un@@ k of me@@ tal is free to act ho@@ we@@ ver it wan@@ ted.    
 And so we meas@@ u@@ red its mo@@ tion.    
 We found it was moving in really we@@ ird wa@@ y@@ s.    
 Instea@@ d of just sitting perfec@@ tly sti@@ ll@@ , it was vi@@ br@@ at@@ ing, and the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was brea@@ thing something like this -- like exp@@ an@@ ding and con@@ trac@@ ting bel@@ low@@ s.    
 And by giving it a g@@ ent@@ le nu@@ dg@@ e, we were able to make it both vi@@ br@@ ate and not vi@@ br@@ ate something that's only allow@@ ed with quan@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ic@@ s.    
 So what I'm telling you here is something truly f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic.    
 What does it mean for one thing to be both vi@@ br@@ ating and not vi@@ br@@ ating at the same ti@@ me@@ ?    
 So let's think about the atom@@ s.    
 So in one ca@@ se@@ : all the tr@@ illi@@ ons of atom@@ s that make up that ch@@ un@@ k of me@@ tal are sitting still and at the same time those same atom@@ s are moving up and dow@@ n.    
 Now it's only at pre@@ ci@@ se times when they al@@ ig@@ n.    
 The rest of the time they're del@@ oc@@ al@@ iz@@ ed.    
 That means that every at@@ om is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire ch@@ un@@ k of me@@ tal is in two different plac@@ es.    
 I think this is really co@@ ol@@ .    
   Re@@ ally.    
   It was worth loc@@ king myself in a clean room to do this for all those years be@@ cause, chec@@ k this out, the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ un@@ k of me@@ tal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ un@@ k of me@@ tal and you.    
 So if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time, that ch@@ un@@ k of me@@ tal can be in two different plac@@ es, then why not you@@ ?    
 I mean, this is just my logical side tal@@ king.    
 So imagine if you're in multi@@ ple places at the same time, what would that be like@@ ?    
 How would your consciousness hand@@ le your body being del@@ oc@@ al@@ ized in spac@@ e?    
 There's one more part to the story.    
 It's when we war@@ med it up, and we turned on the li@@ ghts and looked inside the bo@@ x, we saw that the piece me@@ tal was still there in one piec@@ e.    
 And so I had to de@@ vel@@ op this new intui@@ tion, that it seems like all the objec@@ ts in the el@@ ev@@ at@@ or are really just quan@@ tu@@ m objec@@ ts just cr@@ am@@ med into a tiny spac@@ e.    
 You hear a lot of talk about how quan@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ics says that everything is all inter@@ connec@@ ted.    
 Well, that's not quite right.    
 It's more than that@@ ; it's de@@ e@@ per@@ .    
 It's that those connec@@ tions, your connec@@ tions to all the things around you, literally def@@ ine who you are, and that's the pro@@ found we@@ ir@@ d@@ ness of quan@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ic@@ s.    
 Thank you.    
 My name is A@@ m@@ it.    
 And 1@@ 8 months ago, I had another job at Goog@@ le, and I p@@ it@@ ched this idea of doing something with mus@@ e@@ u@@ ms and art to my b@@ os@@ s who's actually here, and she allow@@ ed me to do it.    
 And it took 1@@ 8 month@@ s.    
 A lot of fun@@ , ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations and stor@@ ies, I can tell you, with 1@@ 7 very interesting mus@@ e@@ u@@ ms from nine countri@@ es.    
 But I'm going to foc@@ us on the demo@@ .    
 There are a lot of stories about why we did this.    
 I think my person@@ al story is expla@@ ined very simply on the sli@@ de, And I grew up in Indi@@ a.    
 I had a great edu@@ cation -- I'm not comp@@ la@@ ining -- but I didn't have acc@@ ess to a lot of these mus@@ e@@ u@@ ms and these ar@@ t@@ work@@ s.    
 And so when I started tra@@ vel@@ ing and going to these mus@@ e@@ um@@ s, I started learning a lo@@ t.    
 And while working at Goog@@ le, I tried to put this des@@ i@@ re to make it more acc@@ es@@ sible with technology together.    
 So we for@@ med a te@@ am, a great team of people, and we started doing this.    
 I'm going to probably get into the de@@ m@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since la@@ un@@ ch.    
 So, simp@@ le@@ : you come to Goog@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ P@@ ro@@ jec@@ t@@ .@@ com@@ .    
 You look around at all these mus@@ e@@ u@@ ms here.    
 You@@ 've got the U@@ ff@@ iz@@ i@@ , you've got the Mo@@ M@@ A@@ , the H@@ er@@ m@@ it@@ age, the Ri@@ j@@ ks, the V@@ an Go@@ gh@@ .    
 I'm going to actually get to one of my favor@@ it@@ es, the M@@ et@@ ro@@ pol@@ it@@ an M@@ us@@ e@@ um of Ar@@ t in New Yor@@ k.    
 Tw@@ o ways of going in -- very simp@@ le.    
 C@@ lic@@ k and, b@@ ang@@ , you're in this mus@@ e@@ u@@ m.    
 It doesn't matter where you are -- B@@ om@@ ba@@ y, M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o, it doesn't really mat@@ ter.    
 You move aroun@@ d, you have fun@@ .    
 You want to na@@ vi@@ g@@ ate around the mus@@ e@@ um@@ ?    
 O@@ p@@ en the pl@@ an up, and, in one c@@ lic@@ k, ju@@ mp@@ .    
 You're in there, you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or.    
 K@@ e@@ ep go@@ ing. H@@ a@@ ve fun@@ .    
 E@@ x@@ p@@ lo@@ re.    
   Th@@ an@@ ks. I haven't come to the best par@@ t.    
   So now I'm in front of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings, "The H@@ ar@@ v@@ es@@ ter@@ s@@ " by P@@ i@@ e@@ ter B@@ ru@@ e@@ ge@@ l at the M@@ e@@ t.    
 I see this pl@@ us sig@@ n.    
 If the mus@@ e@@ um has given us the imag@@ e, you c@@ lic@@ k on it.    
 Now this is one of the imag@@ es.    
 So this is all of the me@@ ta@@ -@@ data information.    
 For those of you who are truly interested in ar@@ t, you can c@@ lic@@ k this -- but I'm going to c@@ lic@@ k this off right now.    
 And this is one of these images that we cap@@ ture@@ d in what we call gi@@ ga@@ pix@@ el technolog@@ y.    
 So this imag@@ e, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixel@@ s.    
 "What do you get for 10 billion pixel@@ s@@ ?"    
 So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixel@@ s.    
 You can z@@ oo@@ m around very simp@@ ly.    
 You see some fu@@ n stuff happen@@ ing here.    
 I love this gu@@ y@@ ; his ex@@ pres@@ sion is pri@@ c@@ el@@ ess.    
 But then you really want to go deep@@ .    
 And so I started playing aroun@@ d, and I found something going on over here.    
 And I was like, "H@@ old on. That soun@@ ds interes@@ t@@ ing@@ ."    
 W@@ ent in, and I started no@@ tic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating some@@ thing.    
 I did a little rese@@ arch@@ , spo@@ ke to a couple of my cont@@ ac@@ ts at the M@@ e@@ t, and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all, which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a s@@ tic@@ k on Sh@@ ro@@ ve T@@ u@@ es@@ day.    
 And app@@ aren@@ tly it was quite pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ .    
 I don't know why they did it, but I learned something about it.    
 Now just to get really de@@ ep in, you can really get to the crac@@ ks.    
 Now just to give you some perspec@@ tive, I'm going to z@@ oo@@ m out so you really see what you ge@@ t.    
 Here is where we wer@@ e, and this is the pain@@ t@@ ing.    
   The best is yet to come -- so in a secon@@ d.    
 So now let's just quick@@ ly ju@@ m@@ p into the Mo@@ M@@ A@@ , again in New Yor@@ k.    
 So another one of my favor@@ it@@ es, "The St@@ ar@@ ry N@@ i@@ ght@@ ."    
 Now the example I show@@ ed you was all about fin@@ ding deta@@ il@@ s.    
 But what if you want to see br@@ us@@ h st@@ ro@@ k@@ es?    
 how V@@ an Go@@ gh actually created this ma@@ ster@@ piec@@ e?    
 You z@@ oo@@ m in. You really go in.    
 I'm going to go to one of my favorite par@@ ts in this pain@@ ting, and I'm really going to get to the crac@@ ks.    
 This is "The St@@ ar@@ ry N@@ i@@ ght@@ ," I think, never seen like this before.    
 I'm going to show you my other favorite fe@@ atu@@ re.    
 There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.    
 This is the real c@@ ool par@@ t. It's called C@@ ol@@ lec@@ tions.    
 An@@ y one of you, anybody -- doesn't matter if you're ri@@ ch, if you're po@@ or, if you have a f@@ anc@@ y house -- doesn't mat@@ ter.    
 You can go and create your own mus@@ e@@ um online -- create your own collec@@ tion across all these imag@@ es.    
 V@@ ery simp@@ ly, you go in -- and I've created this, called The P@@ ow@@ er of Z@@ oo@@ m -- you can just z@@ oo@@ m aroun@@ d.    
 This is "The A@@ mb@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ or@@ s@@ ," based in the Na@@ tional G@@ all@@ er@@ y.    
 You can an@@ no@@ t@@ ate the stuff@@ , s@@ end it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these ma@@ ster@@ piec@@ es.    
 So I think, in con@@ cl@@ usi@@ on, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Goog@@ le.    
 It does@@ n'@@ t, in my opini@@ on, even come from the mus@@ e@@ um@@ s.    
 I probably sh@@ ouldn't say that.    
 It really comes from these arti@@ st@@ s.    
 And that's been my hu@@ mb@@ ling experience in this.    
 I mean, I hope in this digital medi@@ um that we do jus@@ tice to their ar@@ t@@ work and re@@ present it proper@@ ly on@@ lin@@ e.    
 And the biggest question I get asked no@@ wa@@ days is, "D@@ id you do this to re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the experience of going to a mus@@ e@@ um@@ ?"    
 And the answer is no@@ .    
 It's to supp@@ le@@ ment the experienc@@ e.    
 And that's it. Thank you.    
   Thank you.    
 G@@ ood af@@ ter@@ no@@ on, every@@ bod@@ y.    
 I've got something to show you.    
   Th@@ ink about this as a pixel@@ , a fl@@ ying pixel@@ .    
 This is what we call@@ , in our lab@@ , sen@@ sible desig@@ n.    
 L@@ et me tell you a bit about it.    
 Now if you take this picture -- I'm Ital@@ ian or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally, and every boy in Ital@@ y grow@@ s up with this picture on the w@@ all of his be@@ dro@@ om -- but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in F@@ or@@ mul@@ a 1 rac@@ ing over the past couple of deca@@ d@@ es.    
 Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a F@@ or@@ mul@@ a 1 rac@@ e, you take a bu@@ d@@ ge@@ t, and you be@@ t your bu@@ d@@ get on a good dri@@ ver and a good car@@ .    
 And if the car and the dri@@ ver were good enou@@ gh, then you'd win the rac@@ e.    
 Now today, if you want to win the rac@@ e, actually you need also something like this -- something that mon@@ it@@ ors the car in real time, has a few thous@@ and sen@@ sor@@ s collec@@ ting information from the car@@ , tran@@ sm@@ it@@ ting this information into the system@@ , and then process@@ ing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collec@@ ted.    
 This is what@@ , in engine@@ ering ter@@ ms, you would call a real time control system.    
 And bas@@ ic@@ ally, it's a system made of two comp@@ on@@ ents -- a sen@@ sing and an actu@@ ating comp@@ on@@ ent.    
 What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to ent@@ er into our lives.    
 Our ci@@ ties, over the past few years, with net@@ work@@ s, elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s.    
 They're be@@ coming like compu@@ ters in open air@@ .    
 And, as compu@@ ters in open air@@ , they're starting to respon@@ d in a different way to be able to be sen@@ sed and to be actu@@ ated.    
 If we fi@@ x ci@@ ties, actually it's a big de@@ al.    
 Just as an as@@ id@@ e, I wanted to men@@ tion, cities are only two percent of the Ear@@ th@@ 's cru@@ st, but they are 50 percent of the world@@ 's popula@@ tion.    
 They are 7@@ 5 percent of the energy con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion -- up to 8@@ 0 percent of CO2 em@@ is@@ sion@@ s.    
 So if we're able to do something with ci@@ ties, that's a big de@@ al.    
 Be@@ y@@ ond ci@@ ties, all of this sen@@ sing and actu@@ ating is ent@@ ering our every@@ day objec@@ ts.    
 That's from an ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion that P@@ a@@ ol@@ a An@@ ton@@ ell@@ i is organ@@ izing at Mo@@ M@@ A later this year, during the sum@@ mer@@ .    
 It's called "@@ T@@ al@@ k to M@@ e."    
 Well our objec@@ ts, our environment is starting to talk back to us.    
 In a certain sen@@ se, it's almost as if every at@@ om out there were be@@ coming both a sen@@ s@@ or and an actu@@ at@@ or.    
 And that is ra@@ dic@@ ally changing the interac@@ tion we have as human@@ s with the environment out there.    
 In a certain sen@@ se, it's almost as if the old dream of Mi@@ ch@@ el@@ ang@@ el@@ o ...    
 you know, when Mi@@ ch@@ el@@ ang@@ el@@ o sc@@ ul@@ p@@ ted the M@@ os@@ es, at the end it said that he took the ha@@ mm@@ er, thre@@ w it at the M@@ os@@ es -- actually you can still see a small chi@@ p under@@ ne@@ ath -- and said, sh@@ ou@@ ted, "@@ P@@ er@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ li@@ ? Why don't you tal@@ k@@ ?"    
 Well today, for the first time, our environment is starting to talk back to us.    
 And I'll show just a few exam@@ ples -- again, with this idea of sen@@ sing our environment and actu@@ ating it.    
 Let's starting with sen@@ s@@ ing.    
 Well, the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projec@@ ts by our lab@@ .    
 It was four and a half years ago in Ital@@ y.    
 And what we did there was actually use a new type of net@@ work at the time that had been dep@@ lo@@ yed all across the world -- that's a cell@@ phone net@@ work -- and use an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous and ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated information from that net@@ work, that's collec@@ ted any@@ way by the oper@@ at@@ or, in order to understand how the city work@@ s.    
 The sum@@ m@@ er was a luck@@ y sum@@ m@@ er -- 200@@ 6@@ .    
 It's when Ital@@ y w@@ on the so@@ cc@@ er World C@@ up.    
 Some of you might rememb@@ er, it was Ital@@ y and Fran@@ ce play@@ ing, and then Z@@ id@@ an@@ e at the end, the head@@ bu@@ t@@ t.    
 And any@@ way, Ital@@ y w@@ on at the en@@ d.    
   Now look at what happened that day just by mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing ac@@ tiv@@ ity happen@@ ing on the net@@ work.    
 Here you see the city.    
 You see the Co@@ lo@@ s@@ se@@ um in the m@@ idd@@ le, the ri@@ ver T@@ i@@ b@@ er.    
 It's morning, before the mat@@ ch.    
 You see the tim@@ el@@ ine on the top@@ .    
 Ear@@ ly af@@ ter@@ no@@ on, people here and there, making call@@ s and mov@@ ing.    
 The mat@@ ch beg@@ ins -- sil@@ ence.    
 Fran@@ ce s@@ co@@ re@@ s. Ital@@ y s@@ co@@ re@@ s.    
 H@@ al@@ f@@ time, people make a quic@@ k call and go to the ba@@ th@@ room.    
 S@@ econ@@ d hal@@ f@@ . E@@ nd of nor@@ mal time.    
 Fir@@ st over@@ time, secon@@ d.    
 Z@@ id@@ an@@ e, the head@@ bu@@ t@@ t in a mom@@ ent.    
 Ital@@ y win@@ s. Yea@@ h.    
     Well, that night, everybody went to c@@ ele@@ br@@ ate in the cent@@ er.    
 You saw the big pe@@ a@@ k.    
 The follow@@ ing day, again everybody went to the cent@@ er to meet the win@@ ning team and the pri@@ me min@@ ist@@ er at the time.    
 And then everybody moved dow@@ n.    
 You see the image of the place called C@@ ir@@ c@@ o M@@ as@@ si@@ mo@@ , wher@@ e, since R@@ om@@ an times, people go to c@@ ele@@ br@@ at@@ e, to have a big part@@ y, and you see the pe@@ a@@ k at the end of the day.    
 Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago.    
 A@@ no@@ ther quic@@ k example about sen@@ sing@@ : it's not about people, but about things we use and con@@ su@@ me.    
 Well today, we know everything about where our objec@@ ts come from@@ .    
 This is a ma@@ p that show@@ s you all the chi@@ ps that form a Ma@@ c compu@@ ter, how they came together.    
 But we know very little about where things go.    
 So in this projec@@ t, we actually develop@@ ed some small ta@@ g@@ s to tr@@ ack tr@@ as@@ h as it mo@@ ves through the system.    
 So we actually started with a number of volunte@@ ers who helped us in Se@@ att@@ le, just over a year ago, to ta@@ g what they were th@@ row@@ ing away -- different types of things, as you can see here -- things they would th@@ row away any@@ way.    
 Then we put a little chi@@ p, little ta@@ g, onto the tr@@ as@@ h and then started follow@@ ing it.    
 Here are the resul@@ ts we just ob@@ tain@@ ed.    
   F@@ rom Se@@ at@@ tle ...    
 after one wee@@ k.    
 With this information we realized there's a lot of in@@ eff@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es in the system.    
 We can actually do the same thing with much less energ@@ y.    
 This data was not avail@@ able before.    
 But there's a lot of wa@@ sted transp@@ or@@ ta@@ tion and con@@ volu@@ ted things happen@@ ing.    
 But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the c@@ up we're th@@ row@@ ing away, it doesn't disap@@ pe@@ ar, it's still some@@ where on the planet.    
 And the pl@@ as@@ tic bo@@ t@@ tle we're th@@ row@@ ing away every day still sta@@ ys there.    
 And if we show that to people, then we can also prom@@ o@@ te some behavi@@ or@@ al change.    
 So that was the reason for the projec@@ t.    
 My colleag@@ ue at M@@ I@@ T@@ , A@@ s@@ sa@@ f B@@ id@@ er@@ man, he could tell you much more about sen@@ sing and many other wonder@@ ful things we can do with sen@@ s@@ ing, but I wanted to go to the second part we disc@@ us@@ sed at the begin@@ ning, and that's actu@@ ating our environ@@ ment.    
 And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Z@@ ar@@ ago@@ z@@ a, S@@ pa@@ in.    
 It started with a question by the ma@@ y@@ or of the c@@ ity, who came to us sa@@ ying that S@@ pa@@ in and S@@ ou@@ ther@@ n E@@ uro@@ pe have a beautiful tra@@ di@@ tion of using water in public space, in architec@@ ture.    
 And the question was@@ : How could technology, new technology, be ad@@ ded to that?    
 And one of the ideas that was develop@@ ed at M@@ I@@ T in a work@@ sho@@ p was, imagine this pi@@ p@@ e, and you've got val@@ ves, sol@@ en@@ o@@ id val@@ ves, ta@@ ps, op@@ ening and clo@@ s@@ ing.    
 You create like a water cur@@ tain with pixel@@ s made of water.    
 If those pixel@@ s f@@ all, you can write on it, you can show patter@@ n@@ s, imag@@ es, t@@ ex@@ t.    
 And even you can appro@@ ach it, and it will open up to let you ju@@ m@@ p through@@ , as you see in this imag@@ e.    
 Well, we present@@ ed this to Ma@@ y@@ or B@@ el@@ lo@@ ch.    
 He li@@ ked it very much.    
 And we got a comm@@ is@@ sion to design a building at the ent@@ ran@@ ce of the ex@@ po@@ .    
 We called it D@@ ig@@ ital W@@ at@@ er P@@ a@@ vi@@ li@@ on.    
 The whole building is made of water.    
 There's no do@@ ors or win@@ dow@@ s, but when you appro@@ ach it, it will open up to let you in.    
   The ro@@ of also is cover@@ ed with water.    
 And if there's a bit of win@@ d, if you want to min@@ im@@ ize sp@@ l@@ ash@@ ing, you can actually low@@ er the ro@@ of.    
 Or you could close the build@@ ing, and the whole architec@@ ture will disap@@ pe@@ ar, like in this ca@@ se.    
 You know, these days, you always get images during the w@@ inter@@ , when they take the ro@@ of dow@@ n, of people who have been there and said, "@@ They demo@@ li@@ sh@@ ed the build@@ ing@@ ."    
 No, they didn't demo@@ lish it, just when it goes dow@@ n, the architec@@ ture almost disap@@ pe@@ ar@@ s.    
 Here's the building work@@ ing.    
 You see the person pu@@ z@@ z@@ led about what was going on insid@@ e.    
 And here was myself trying not to get we@@ t, tes@@ ting the sen@@ sor@@ s that open the water.    
 Well, I should tell you now what happened one ni@@ ght when all of the sen@@ sor@@ s stopped work@@ ing.    
 But actually that night, it was even more fun@@ .    
 All the kids from Z@@ ar@@ ago@@ z@@ a came to the build@@ ing, because the way of eng@@ ag@@ ing with the building became something differ@@ ent.    
 Not any@@ more a building that would open up to let you in, but a building that would still make cu@@ ts and hol@@ es through the wat@@ er, and you had to ju@@ m@@ p without getting we@@ t.    
    And that was, for us, was very interes@@ ting, be@@ cause, as architec@@ ts, as engine@@ ers, as desig@@ n@@ ers, we always think about how people will use the things we desig@@ n.    
 But then real@@ it@@ y's always un@@ pre@@ dic@@ tab@@ le.    
 And that's the beau@@ ty of doing things that are used and inter@@ act with people.    
 Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixel@@ s, the pixel@@ s made of wat@@ er, and then projec@@ tions on them.    
 the follow@@ ing project I'll show you now.    
 Th@@ at@@ '@@ s, imagine those pixel@@ s could actually start fl@@ y@@ ing.    
 I@@ mag@@ ine you could have small he@@ lic@@ op@@ ters that move in the air@@ , and then each of them with a small pix@@ el in changing li@@ ghts -- almost as a cl@@ oud that can move in spac@@ e.    
 Here is the vide@@ o.    
   So imagine one he@@ lic@@ op@@ ter, moving with other@@ s, in syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ y.    
 So you can have this cl@@ ou@@ d.    
 You can have a kind of f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble scre@@ en or disp@@ la@@ y, like this -- a re@@ gu@@ lar con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tion in two di@@ men@@ sion@@ s.    
 Or in re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar, but in three di@@ men@@ sion@@ s, where the thing that changes is the li@@ ght, not the pixel@@ s' posi@@ tion.    
 You can play with a different typ@@ e.    
 I@@ mag@@ ine your scre@@ en could just appe@@ ar in different scal@@ es or si@@ z@@ es, different types of res@@ olu@@ tion.    
 But then the whole thing can be just a 3@@ D cl@@ oud of pixel@@ s that you can appro@@ ach and move through it and see from man@@ y, many direc@@ tions.    
 Here is the real F@@ ly@@ fire control and going down to form the re@@ gu@@ lar g@@ ri@@ d as before.    
 When you turn on the li@@ ght, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.    
 And imagine each of them then contro@@ l@@ led by people.    
 You can have each pix@@ el having an in@@ put that comes from people, from people@@ 's mov@@ em@@ ent, or so and so@@ .    
 I want to show you something here for the first time.    
 We've been working with R@@ ob@@ er@@ to B@@ ol@@ le, one of to@@ da@@ y's top bal@@ let danc@@ ers -- the é@@ to@@ i@@ le at M@@ et@@ ro@@ pol@@ it@@ an in New York and L@@ a S@@ cal@@ a in M@@ il@@ an -- and actually cap@@ ture@@ d his mov@@ ement in 3@@ D in order to use it as an in@@ put for F@@ ly@@ fi@@ re.    
 And here you can see R@@ ob@@ er@@ to danc@@ ing.    
 You see on the left the pixel@@ s, the different res@@ olu@@ tions being cap@@ ture@@ d.    
 It's both 3@@ D s@@ can@@ ning in real time and mo@@ tion cap@@ ture.    
 So you can re@@ construc@@ t a whole mov@@ em@@ ent.    
 You can go all the way through@@ .    
 But then, once we have the pixel@@ s, then you can play with them and play with color and mov@@ ement and gra@@ v@@ ity and ro@@ ta@@ tion.    
 So we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ pu@@ ts for F@@ ly@@ fi@@ re.    
 I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.    
 It's something we're working on for the L@@ on@@ d@@ on O@@ ly@@ mp@@ ic@@ s.    
 It's called The C@@ l@@ ou@@ d.    
 And the idea here is, imagin@@ e, again, we can invol@@ ve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to imp@@ art what we call cl@@ oud rais@@ ing -- like bar@@ n rais@@ ing, but with a cl@@ ou@@ d.    
 I@@ mag@@ ine you can have everybody make a small don@@ ation for one pixel@@ .    
 And I think what is re@@ mar@@ k@@ able that has happened over the past couple of years is that, over the past couple of deca@@ d@@ es, we went from the physical world to the digital one.    
 This has been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing every@@ thing, knowle@@ dg@@ e, and making that acc@@ es@@ sible through the Inter@@ ne@@ t.    
 Now today, for the first time -- and the O@@ b@@ am@@ a camp@@ a@@ ign show@@ ed us this -- we can go from the digital world, from the self-@@ organ@@ izing power of net@@ work@@ s, to the physical one.    
 This can be, in our case, we want to use it for desig@@ ning and doing a sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ .    
 That means something built in a city.    
 But tom@@ or@@ row it can be, in order to t@@ ack@@ le to@@ da@@ y's pres@@ sing challeng@@ es -- think about climate change or CO2 em@@ is@@ sions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.    
 So the idea that we can actually invol@@ ve people in doing this thing together, collec@@ tiv@@ el@@ y.    
 The cl@@ oud is a cl@@ ou@@ d, again, made of pixel@@ s, in the same way as the real cl@@ oud is a cl@@ oud made of partic@@ les.    
 And those partic@@ les are wat@@ er, where our cl@@ oud is a cl@@ oud of pixel@@ s.    
 It's a physical struc@@ ture in L@@ on@@ don@@ , but cover@@ ed with pixel@@ s.    
 You can move insid@@ e, have different types of experienc@@ es.    
 You can actually see from under@@ ne@@ a@@ th, sh@@ aring the main moments for the O@@ ly@@ mp@@ ics in 20@@ 1@@ 2 and bey@@ on@@ d, and really using it as a way to con@@ ne@@ ct with the commun@@ ity.    
 So both the physical cl@@ oud in the sk@@ y and something you can go to the top [@@ of@@ ]@@ , like L@@ on@@ don@@ 's new moun@@ tain@@ top@@ .    
 You can ent@@ er inside it.    
 And a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the ni@@ ght -- but most import@@ ant@@ ly, a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top@@ .    
 Thank you.    
 How would you like to be better than you are@@ ?    
 Su@@ pp@@ ose I said that, with just a few changes in your gen@@ es, you could get a better memory -- more pre@@ ci@@ se, more acc@@ ur@@ ate and quick@@ er.    
 Or maybe you'd like to be more f@@ it, str@@ ong@@ er, with more st@@ am@@ in@@ a.    
 W@@ ould you like to be more at@@ trac@@ tive and self-@@ conf@@ id@@ ent@@ ?    
 How about living longer with good health@@ ?    
 Or perhaps you're one of those who's always year@@ ned for more creativ@@ ity.    
 Wh@@ ich one would you like the mo@@ st@@ ?    
 Wh@@ ich would you like, if you could have just on@@ e?    
   C@@ rea@@ tiv@@ ity.    
 How many people would choose creativ@@ it@@ y?    
 R@@ a@@ ise your han@@ ds. L@@ et me se@@ e.    
 A fe@@ w@@ . P@@ rob@@ ably about as many as there are creative people here.    
  That's very goo@@ d.    
 How many would op@@ t for memor@@ y?    
 Q@@ u@@ ite a few more.    
 How about f@@ it@@ n@@ ess@@ ?    
 A few l@@ ess.    
 What about l@@ on@@ ge@@ v@@ it@@ y?    
 A@@ h, the maj@@ or@@ ity. That makes me feel very good as a doc@@ tor@@ .    
 If you could have any one of thes@@ e, it would be a very different world.    
 Is it just imagin@@ ar@@ y?    
 O@@ r@@ , is it, perha@@ ps, possib@@ le@@ ?    
 E@@ volu@@ tion has been a per@@ en@@ ni@@ al top@@ ic here at the TED Con@@ fer@@ ence, but I want to give you today one doc@@ tor@@ 's take on the subjec@@ t.    
 The great 20@@ th@@ -@@ centur@@ y gene@@ tici@@ st, who was also a communic@@ ant in the R@@ us@@ si@@ an O@@ r@@ tho@@ do@@ x Ch@@ ur@@ ch, once wrote an es@@ say that he ti@@ t@@ led "@@ No@@ thing in B@@ i@@ o@@ logy Ma@@ kes S@@ en@@ se E@@ x@@ cep@@ t in the Li@@ ght of E@@ volu@@ tion@@ ."    
 Now if you are one of those who does not acc@@ ept the evidence for bio@@ logical evolu@@ tion, this would be a very good time to turn off your hear@@ ing a@@ id@@ , take out your person@@ al communi@@ cations de@@ vice -- I give you per@@ mis@@ sion -- and perhaps take another look at K@@ a@@ th@@ r@@ y@@ n S@@ ch@@ ul@@ t@@ z@@ 's book on being wr@@ ong, because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense what@@ so@@ ever to you.    
   But if you do acc@@ ept bio@@ logical evolu@@ tion, consid@@ er this: is it just about the pa@@ st, or is it about the fu@@ ture@@ ?    
 Do@@ es it app@@ ly to other@@ s, or does it app@@ ly to us@@ ?    
 This is another look at the t@@ ree of life.    
 In this pic@@ ture, I've put a bus@@ h with a cent@@ er bran@@ ching out in all direc@@ tions, because if you look at the ed@@ g@@ es of the t@@ ree of life, every exist@@ ing species at the ti@@ ps of those bran@@ ch@@ es has succ@@ e@@ ed@@ ed in evolu@@ tionary ter@@ m@@ s: it has survi@@ v@@ ed@@ ; it has de@@ mon@@ str@@ ated a f@@ it@@ ness to its environ@@ ment.    
 The human part of this bran@@ ch, way out on one end, is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.    
 We bran@@ ch off of a comm@@ on anc@@ es@@ tor to moder@@ n ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es about six or eight million years ago.    
 In the inter@@ v@@ al, there have been perhaps 20 or 2@@ 5 different species of hom@@ in@@ id@@ s.    
 Some have come and g@@ one.    
 We have been here for about 1@@ 3@@ 0@@ ,000 years.    
 It may seem like we're quite re@@ mo@@ te from other par@@ ts of this t@@ ree of life, but actu@@ ally, for the most par@@ t, the basic mach@@ in@@ ery of our cell@@ s is pretty much the sam@@ e.    
 Do you realize that we can take adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge and com@@ man@@ de@@ er the mach@@ in@@ ery of a comm@@ on bacteri@@ um to produce the prote@@ in of human in@@ sul@@ in used to tre@@ at di@@ a@@ be@@ tic@@ s?    
 This is not like human in@@ su@@ lin@@ ; this is the same prote@@ in that is chem@@ ically indi@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ as@@ .    
 And spea@@ king of bacteri@@ a, do you realize that each of us car@@ ri@@ es in our g@@ ut more bacteri@@ a than there are cell@@ s in the rest of our bod@@ y?    
 Maybe 10 times more.    
 I mean think of it, when An@@ ton@@ i@@ o D@@ ama@@ si@@ o as@@ ks about your self-@@ imag@@ e, do you think about the bacteri@@ a@@ ?    
 Our g@@ ut is a wonder@@ fully hosp@@ it@@ able environment for those bacteri@@ a.    
 It's war@@ m, it's dar@@ k, it's mo@@ ist@@ , it's very co@@ z@@ y.    
 And you're going to provid@@ e all the nu@@ tri@@ tion that they could possib@@ ly want with no eff@@ ort on their par@@ t.    
 It's really like an E@@ as@@ y S@@ tre@@ et for bacteri@@ a, of the un@@ in@@ t@@ ended forced r@@ us@@ h to the ex@@ it.    
 But other@@ wis@@ e, you are a wonder@@ ful environment for those bacteri@@ a, just as they are ess@@ ential to your life.    
 They help in the dig@@ es@@ tion of ess@@ ential nu@@ tri@@ ents, and they prote@@ ct you against certain diseas@@ es.    
 But what will come in the fu@@ ture@@ ?    
 Are we at some kind of evolu@@ tionary e@@ qui@@ po@@ ise as a speci@@ es?    
 O@@ r@@ , are we des@@ t@@ ined to become something different -- some@@ thing, perha@@ ps, even better adap@@ ted to the environ@@ ment@@ ?    
 Now let's take a step back in time to the B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang@@ , 1@@ 4 billion years ago -- the Ear@@ th, the sol@@ ar system@@ , about four and a half billion years -- the first sig@@ ns of pro@@ to-@@ life, maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth -- the first multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organ@@ is@@ ms, as 8@@ 00 or a billion years ago -- and then the human speci@@ es, finally emerg@@ ing in the last 1@@ 3@@ 0@@ ,000 years. In this v@@ ast un@@ fin@@ ish@@ ed sy@@ mp@@ hon@@ y of the univer@@ se,    
 life on Earth is like a bri@@ ef meas@@ u@@ re@@ ; the ani@@ mal k@@ ing@@ dom@@ , like a single meas@@ u@@ re@@ ; and human life, a small gr@@ ace no@@ t@@ e.    
 That was us.    
 That also con@@ stitu@@ tes the enter@@ tain@@ ment por@@ tion of this tal@@ k, so I hope you en@@ jo@@ yed it.    
   Now when I was a fre@@ sh@@ man in colle@@ g@@ e, I took my first bio@@ logy clas@@ s.    
 I was fascin@@ ated by the el@@ eg@@ ance and beau@@ ty of bio@@ log@@ y.    
 I became en@@ am@@ ore@@ d of the power of evolu@@ tion, and I realized something very fundament@@ al@@ : in most of the exist@@ ence of life in sing@@ le@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organ@@ is@@ ms, each cell simply di@@ vid@@ es, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is car@@ ried on in both daughter cell@@ s.    
 But at the time multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organ@@ is@@ ms come on@@ lin@@ e, things start to change.    
 S@@ ex@@ u@@ al re@@ produc@@ tion ent@@ ers the pic@@ ture.    
 And very import@@ ant@@ ly, with the intro@@ duc@@ tion of sex@@ u@@ al re@@ produc@@ tion that pas@@ ses on the gen@@ om@@ e, the rest of the body becomes exp@@ end@@ able.    
 In fact, you could say that the in@@ ev@@ it@@ ability of the death of our bodies ent@@ ers in evolu@@ tionary time at the same moment as sex@@ u@@ al re@@ produc@@ tion.    
 Now I have to conf@@ ess, when I was a colle@@ ge under@@ gradu@@ at@@ e, I thought, oka@@ y, sex@@ /@@ dea@@ th, sex@@ /@@ dea@@ th, death for sex -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time, but with each pas@@ sing year, I've come to have increas@@ ing d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts.    
 I've come to understand the sen@@ tim@@ ents of G@@ e@@ or@@ ge B@@ ur@@ n@@ s, who was perfor@@ m@@ ing still in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as well into his 9@@ 0@@ s.    
 And one night, there's a kno@@ ck at his ho@@ te@@ l room do@@ or.    
 He answ@@ ers the do@@ or.    
 St@@ an@@ ding before him is a g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous, s@@ can@@ ti@@ ly cla@@ d show@@ girl@@ .    
 She looks at him and says, "I'm here for su@@ per sex@@ ."    
 "@@ That's fin@@ e@@ ," says G@@ e@@ org@@ e, "@@ I'll take the sou@@ p@@ ."    
   I came to real@@ iz@@ e, as a physic@@ i@@ an, that I was working tow@@ ard a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necess@@ arily con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tor@@ y, just differ@@ ent.    
 I was trying to pres@@ er@@ ve the bod@@ y.    
 I wanted to keep us health@@ y.    
 I wanted to re@@ store health from diseas@@ e.    
 I wanted us to live long and health@@ y lives.    
 E@@ volu@@ tion is all about pas@@ sing on the gen@@ ome to the next gener@@ ation, adap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after gener@@ ation.    
 F@@ rom an evolu@@ tionary point of view@@ , you and I are like the boo@@ ster ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts desig@@ ned to s@@ end the genetic pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad into the next level of or@@ bit and then dro@@ p off into the se@@ a.    
 I think we would all understand the sen@@ tim@@ ent that W@@ oo@@ dy Al@@ le@@ n ex@@ pres@@ sed when he said, "I don't want to achi@@ eve im@@ mor@@ tal@@ ity through my work.    
 I want to achi@@ eve it through not dy@@ ing@@ ."    
   E@@ volu@@ tion does not necess@@ arily fa@@ v@@ or the long@@ est@@ -@@ liv@@ ed.    
 It doesn't necess@@ arily fa@@ v@@ or the biggest or the str@@ ong@@ est or the fa@@ st@@ es@@ t, and not even the smar@@ tes@@ t.    
 E@@ volu@@ tion fa@@ v@@ ors those creatu@@ res best adap@@ ted to their environ@@ ment.    
 That is the so@@ le test of survi@@ v@@ al and succ@@ ess.    
 At the bo@@ t@@ to@@ m of the oce@@ an, bacteri@@ a that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ c and can survi@@ ve at the stea@@ m v@@ ent he@@ at that would other@@ w@@ ise produc@@ e, if fish were there, s@@ ous@@ -@@ vid@@ e c@@ oo@@ ked fish@@ , ne@@ ver@@ the@@ l@@ ess, have manag@@ ed to make that a hosp@@ it@@ able environment for them.    
 So what does this mean, as we look back at what has happened in evolu@@ tion, and as we think about the place again of human@@ s in evolu@@ tion, and particularly as we look a@@ head to the next p@@ ha@@ se, I would say that there are a number of possibili@@ ties.    
 The first is that we will not ev@@ ol@@ ve.    
 We have reach@@ ed a kind of e@@ qui@@ po@@ is@@ e.    
 And the reas@@ on@@ ing behind that would be, fir@@ st, we ha@@ ve, through medic@@ ine, manag@@ ed to pres@@ er@@ ve a lot of gen@@ es and be re@@ moved from the popula@@ tion.    
 And secon@@ d@@ ly, we as a species have so con@@ figu@@ red our environment that we have manag@@ ed to make it adap@@ t to us as well as we adap@@ t to it.    
 And by the way, we im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ate and cir@@ cul@@ ate and inter@@ mi@@ x so much that you can't any longer have the is@@ ol@@ ation that is necess@@ ary for evolution to take plac@@ e.    
 A second possib@@ ility is that there will be evolution of the tra@@ di@@ tional kin@@ d, n@@ atur@@ al, imp@@ osed by the forc@@ es of natu@@ re.    
 And the argu@@ ment here would be that the whe@@ el@@ s of evolution gr@@ ind s@@ low@@ ly, but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able.    
 And as far as is@@ ol@@ ation go@@ es, when we as a species do col@@ on@@ ize dist@@ ant plan@@ et@@ s, there will be the is@@ ol@@ ation and the environ@@ mental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way.    
 But there's a third possib@@ il@@ ity, an enti@@ c@@ ing, in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing and fri@@ ght@@ ening possib@@ ility.    
 I call it ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply n@@ atur@@ al, but gu@@ ided and ch@@ os@@ en by us as individu@@ als in the choices that we will ma@@ k@@ e.    
 Now how could this come ab@@ out@@ ?    
 How could it be possible that we would do this?    
 Con@@ sid@@ er, fir@@ st, the reality that people today, in some cul@@ tures, are making choices about their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing.    
 The@@ y@@ '@@ re, in some cul@@ tures, choos@@ ing to have more mal@@ es than fe@@ mal@@ es.    
 It's not necess@@ arily good for the societ@@ y, but it's what the individual and the family are choos@@ ing.    
 Th@@ ink al@@ so, if it were possible ever for you to choos@@ e, not simply to choose the sex of your chil@@ d, but for you in your body to make the genetic ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments that would cu@@ re or pre@@ v@@ ent diseas@@ es.    
 What if you could make the genetic changes to e@@ li@@ min@@ ate di@@ a@@ bet@@ es or Al@@ z@@ he@@ i@@ mer@@ 's or re@@ duce the ris@@ k of can@@ c@@ er or e@@ li@@ min@@ ate st@@ ro@@ ke@@ ?    
 W@@ ouldn't you want to make those changes in your gen@@ es?    
 If we look a@@ hea@@ d, these kind of changes are going to be increas@@ ingly possib@@ le.    
 The H@@ u@@ man G@@ en@@ ome P@@ ro@@ jec@@ t started in 19@@ 9@@ 0, and it took 1@@ 3 years.    
 It cost 2@@ .@@ 7 billion dollar@@ s.    
 The year after it was fin@@ ish@@ ed in 200@@ 4@@ , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four month@@ s.    
 To@@ day, you can have a comple@@ te sequ@@ ence of the three billion bas@@ e pa@@ ir@@ s in the human gen@@ ome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a wee@@ k.    
 It won@@ 't be very long before the reality will be the 1@@ ,00@@ 0@@ -@@ dol@@ lar human gen@@ om@@ e, and it will be increas@@ ingly avail@@ able for every@@ one.    
 Just a week ago, the Na@@ tional A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Eng@@ ine@@ ering a@@ war@@ ded its D@@ ra@@ per P@@ ri@@ ze to Fran@@ c@@ is Ar@@ no@@ ld and W@@ il@@ le@@ m Ste@@ mm@@ er, two scientists who in@@ dep@@ end@@ ently develop@@ ed techniques to en@@ courage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to le@@ ad to des@@ ir@@ able prote@@ ins in a more eff@@ ici@@ ent way -- what Fran@@ ces Ar@@ no@@ ld call@@ s "@@ direc@@ ted evolu@@ tion@@ ."    
 A couple of years ago, the L@@ as@@ k@@ er P@@ ri@@ ze was a@@ war@@ ded to the scienti@@ st Sh@@ in@@ y@@ a Y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an ad@@ ult sk@@ in c@@ ell, a fi@@ bro@@ b@@ la@@ st, and by man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating just four gen@@ es, he in@@ duc@@ ed that cell to re@@ ver@@ t to a pl@@ u@@ ri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell pot@@ entially cap@@ able of be@@ coming any cell in your bod@@ y.    
 These changes are com@@ ing.    
 The same technology that has produc@@ ed the human in@@ sul@@ in in bacteri@@ a can make vir@@ us@@ es that will not only prote@@ ct you against them@@ selv@@ es, but in@@ duce im@@ m@@ un@@ ity against other vir@@ us@@ es.    
 Be@@ li@@ eve it or not, there's an experi@@ mental tri@@ al going on with vacc@@ ine against in@@ flu@@ en@@ z@@ a that has been grow@@ n in the cell@@ s of a to@@ bac@@ c@@ o plan@@ t.    
 Can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ bac@@ co@@ ?    
 These are all reality today, and [@@ in@@ ] the fu@@ ture, will be ever@@ more possib@@ le.    
 I@@ mag@@ ine then just two other little chang@@ es.    
 You can change the cell@@ s in your bod@@ y, but what if you could change the cell@@ s in your off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing?    
 What if you could change the s@@ per@@ m and the o@@ v@@ a, or change the new@@ ly fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zed e@@ gg@@ , and give your off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing a better chance at a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- e@@ li@@ min@@ ate the di@@ a@@ bet@@ es, e@@ li@@ min@@ ate the h@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ li@@ a, re@@ duce the ris@@ k of can@@ cer@@ ?    
 Who doesn't want heal@@ thi@@ er children@@ ?    
 And then, that same an@@ aly@@ tic technology, that same eng@@ ine of science that can produce the changes to pre@@ v@@ ent diseas@@ e, will also en@@ able us that better memor@@ y.    
 Why not have the quic@@ k w@@ it of a K@@ en J@@ en@@ n@@ ings, especially if you can au@@ g@@ ment it with the next generation of the W@@ at@@ son mach@@ ine@@ ?    
 Why not have the quic@@ k t@@ wit@@ ch mus@@ cle that will en@@ able you to run faster and long@@ er@@ ?    
 Why not live long@@ er@@ ?    
 These will be ir@@ re@@ si@@ sti@@ b@@ le.    
 And when we are at a posi@@ tion where we can pas@@ s it on to the next gener@@ ation, and we can ad@@ op@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes we wan@@ t, we will have conver@@ ted ol@@ d-@@ st@@ y@@ le evolution into ne@@ o@@ -@@ evolu@@ tion.    
 We@@ 'll take a process that nor@@ m@@ ally might re@@ qui@@ re 1@@ 00@@ ,000 years, and we can comp@@ res@@ s it down to a thous@@ and years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years.    
 These are choices that your grand@@ children, or their grand@@ children, are going to have before them.    
 W@@ ill we use these choices to make a society that is bet@@ ter, that is more success@@ ful, that is kin@@ der@@ ?    
 O@@ r@@ , will we sel@@ ec@@ tively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for other@@ s of us@@ ?    
 W@@ ill we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ for@@ m, or more rob@@ ust and more ver@@ sa@@ ti@@ le@@ ?    
 These are the kinds of questions that we will have to fac@@ e.    
 And most prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly of all, will we ever be able to de@@ vel@@ op the wis@@ dom@@ , and to in@@ her@@ it the wis@@ dom@@ , that we@@ 'll need to make these choices wis@@ el@@ y?    
 For better or wor@@ se, and so@@ on@@ er than you may think, these choices will be up to us.    
 Thank you.    
 I@@ mag@@ ine a plan@@ e full of s@@ mo@@ k@@ e.    
 I@@ mag@@ ine an eng@@ ine going cl@@ ac@@ k, cl@@ ac@@ k, cl@@ ac@@ k.    
 It soun@@ ds sc@@ ary.    
 Well, I had a unique se@@ at that day.    
 I was sitting in 1@@ D@@ .    
 I was the only one who could talk to the f@@ light att@@ end@@ an@@ ts.    
 So I looked at them right away, and they said, "@@ No problem. We probably hit some bir@@ d@@ s."    
 The pi@@ lot had already turned the plan@@ e aroun@@ d, and we weren't that far@@ .    
 You could see Man@@ h@@ att@@ an.    
 Tw@@ o minut@@ es later, three things happened at the same time.    
 The pi@@ lot lin@@ es up the plan@@ e with the H@@ u@@ d@@ son Ri@@ ver.    
 That's usually not the rou@@ t@@ e.    
   He turns off the eng@@ in@@ es.    
 Now, imagine being in a plan@@ e with no soun@@ d.    
 And then he says three wor@@ ds.    
 The most u@@ ne@@ mo@@ tional three words I've ever hear@@ d.    
 He says, "@@ B@@ rac@@ e for imp@@ ac@@ t@@ ."    
 I didn't have to talk to the f@@ light att@@ end@@ ant any@@ more.    
   I could see in her ey@@ es, it was ter@@ r@@ or.    
 Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.    
 I learned that it all changes in an instan@@ t.    
 We have this b@@ uc@@ ket li@@ st, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to re@@ ach out to that I di@@ d@@ n'@@ t, all the f@@ ences I wanted to men@@ d, all the experienc@@ es I wanted to have and I never di@@ d.    
 As I thought about that later on, I came up with a say@@ ing, which is, "I colle@@ ct bad win@@ es@@ ."    
 Because if the w@@ ine is ready and the person is there, I'm op@@ ening it.    
 I no longer want to po@@ st@@ p@@ one anything in life.    
 And that ur@@ g@@ enc@@ y, that pur@@ pos@@ e, has really changed my life.    
 The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we cle@@ ar the G@@ e@@ or@@ ge W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on B@@ ri@@ dg@@ e, which was by not a lot -- I thought ab@@ out, w@@ ow, I really feel one real re@@ gre@@ t.    
 I've li@@ ved a good life.    
 In my own human@@ ity and mista@@ k@@ es, I've tried to get better at everything I tri@@ ed.    
 But in my human@@ ity, I also allow my e@@ go to get in.    
 And I re@@ gre@@ t@@ ted the time I wa@@ sted on things that did not matter with people that mat@@ ter.    
 And I thought about my relationship with my wi@@ f@@ e, with my friends, with people.    
 And af@@ ter, as I ref@@ lec@@ ted on that, I decided to e@@ li@@ min@@ ate nega@@ tive energy from my life.    
 It's not perfec@@ t, but it's a lot better.    
 I've not had a fi@@ ght with my wi@@ fe in two years.    
 It feel@@ s great@@ .    
 I no longer try to be ri@@ ght@@ ; I choose to be happ@@ y.    
 The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clo@@ ck starts go@@ ing, "@@ 1@@ 5@@ , 1@@ 4@@ , 1@@ 3@@ ."    
 You can see the water com@@ ing.    
 I'm say@@ ing, "@@ P@@ le@@ ase b@@ low up@@ ."    
 I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ari@@ es.    
 And as we're coming dow@@ n, I had a sense of, w@@ ow, d@@ ying is not sc@@ ary.    
 It's almost like we've been pre@@ par@@ ing for it our whole lives.    
 But it was very sa@@ d.    
 I didn't want to go@@ ; I love my life.    
 And that sa@@ d@@ ness really f@@ r@@ am@@ ed in one thought, which is, I only w@@ ish for one thing.    
 I only w@@ ish I could see my kids grow up.    
 A@@ b@@ out a mon@@ th later, I was at a perfor@@ man@@ ce by my daughter -- fir@@ st@@ -@@ gra@@ d@@ er, not much arti@@ sti@@ c tal@@ ent -- Y@@ et@@ !    
   And I'm b@@ aw@@ l@@ ing, I'm cr@@ y@@ ing, like a little kid@@ .    
 And it made all the sense in the world to me.    
 I realized at that poin@@ t, by connec@@ ting those two do@@ ts, that the only thing that mat@@ ters in my life is being a great da@@ d.    
 A@@ bo@@ ve all, abo@@ ve all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good da@@ d.    
 I was given the gi@@ ft of a mirac@@ le, of not d@@ ying that day.    
 I was given another gi@@ f@@ t, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differ@@ ent@@ ly.    
 I challenge you guys that are fl@@ ying today, imagine the same thing happens on your plan@@ e -- and please don't -- but imagin@@ e, and how would you chan@@ ge@@ ?    
 What would you get done that you're wa@@ iting to get done because you think you'll be here fore@@ ver@@ ?    
 How would you change your relationshi@@ ps and the nega@@ tive energy in them@@ ?    
 And more than any@@ thing, are you being the best paren@@ t you can@@ ?    
 Thank you.    
 I have had the dist@@ in@@ ct bl@@ ess@@ ing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projec@@ ts.    
 But the co@@ ol@@ est I ever worked on was around this gu@@ y.    
 This gu@@ y's name is TE@@ M@@ P@@ T@@ .    
 TE@@ M@@ P@@ T was one of the fore@@ most gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i arti@@ sts in the 80@@ s.    
 And he came up home from a run one day and said, "D@@ a@@ d, my leg@@ s are t@@ ing@@ l@@ ing@@ ."    
 And that was the on@@ set of A@@ L@@ S.    
 So TE@@ M@@ P@@ T is now completely par@@ aly@@ z@@ ed.    
 He only has use of his ey@@ es.    
 I was ex@@ pos@@ ed to him.    
 I have a company that does design and ani@@ ma@@ tion, so obvi@@ ously gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i is defin@@ it@@ ely an in@@ tric@@ ate part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and res@@ pect in the art world.    
 And so we decided that we were going to spon@@ s@@ or T@@ on@@ y, TE@@ M@@ P@@ T@@ , and his caus@@ e.    
 So I went and met with his bro@@ ther and father and said, "@@ We're going to give you this mone@@ y.    
 What are you going to do with it@@ ?"    
 And his bro@@ ther said, "I just want to be able to talk to T@@ on@@ y again.    
 I just want to be able to communic@@ ate with him and him to be able to communic@@ ate with me@@ ."    
 And I said, "@@ W@@ a@@ it a secon@@ d, isn't that -- I've seen Ste@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king -- don't all par@@ aly@@ zed people have the ability to communic@@ ate vi@@ a these de@@ vic@@ es@@ ?"    
 And he said, "@@ No, un@@ less you're in the u@@ pp@@ er e@@ ch@@ el@@ on and you've got really amazing in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce, you can't actually do that.    
 These de@@ vic@@ es aren't acc@@ es@@ sible to people@@ ."    
 And I said, "Well, how do you actually communic@@ at@@ e@@ ?"    
 H@@ as everyone seen the movie "The Di@@ ving B@@ ell and the B@@ ut@@ ter@@ fl@@ y@@ ?"    
 That's how they communic@@ ate -- so run their fing@@ er al@@ ong@@ .    
 I said, "@@ That's ar@@ cha@@ ic. How can that be@@ ?"    
 So I show@@ ed up with the des@@ i@@ re to just write a chec@@ k, and instea@@ d, I wrote a chec@@ k that I had no f@@ rea@@ king idea how I was going to ca@@ sh@@ .    
 I comm@@ it@@ ted to his bro@@ ther and his father right then and there -- I'm like, "@@ All right, here's the de@@ al@@ : T@@ on@@ y's going to spea@@ k, we're going to get him a mach@@ ine, and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.    
 Because it's a tra@@ v@@ es@@ ty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communic@@ ate it@@ ."    
 So I spo@@ ke at a conf@@ er@@ ence a couple months after that.    
 I met these guys called G@@ R@@ L@@ , G@@ ra@@ ff@@ it@@ i R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch L@@ ab@@ , and they have a technology that allow@@ s them to project a light onto any sur@@ face and then, with a las@@ er po@@ inter@@ , dra@@ w on it, and it just re@@ gi@@ st@@ ers the nega@@ tive spac@@ e.    
 So they go around and do art in@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tions like this.    
 All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cy@@ c@@ le.    
 Fir@@ st it starts with the sex@@ u@@ al organ@@ s, then it starts with c@@ us@@ s words, then it was B@@ us@@ h s@@ lan@@ d@@ ers and then people actually got to ar@@ t.    
 But there was always a life cy@@ cle to their present@@ a@@ tions.    
 So I went home and was having d@@ inner with my wi@@ fe and was telling her about this, and we were like, "@@ Well wa@@ it a secon@@ d. If we know that this technology exist@@ s where you can use your ey@@ es to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TE@@ M@@ P@@ T to control a las@@ er and he could do gra@@ f again@@ ? Well that would be aw@@ es@@ ome@@ ."    
 So that started the jour@@ ne@@ y.    
 And about two years later, about a year later, after a bunch of organ@@ iz@@ ation and a bunch of moving things aroun@@ d, we@@ 'd ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ed a couple things.    
 O@@ n@@ e, we bat@@ tered down the do@@ ors of the in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce comp@@ ani@@ es, and we actually got TE@@ M@@ P@@ T a machine that let him communic@@ ate -- a Ste@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king mach@@ ine.    
   Wh@@ ich was aw@@ es@@ om@@ e.    
 And he's seri@@ ously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- I call him Y@@ o@@ da@@ , because you talk to the gu@@ y, you get an e@@ ma@@ il from him, and you're like, "I'm not wor@@ th@@ y. This gu@@ y's so ama@@ z@@ ing@@ ."    
 The other thing we did is we f@@ le@@ w seven progr@@ am@@ m@@ ers from all over the world -- literally every cor@@ ner of the world -- into our hous@@ e.    
 My wi@@ fe and kids and I moved to our back gar@@ age, and these ha@@ c@@ k@@ ers and progr@@ am@@ m@@ ers and con@@ spir@@ ac@@ y theor@@ ists and an@@ arch@@ ists took over our hous@@ e.    
 A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stu@@ pi@@ d to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the w@@ all would be re@@ moved and gra@@ f on the w@@ all@@ s.    
 But for over two wee@@ ks, we progr@@ am@@ me@@ d, we went to the V@@ en@@ ice bo@@ ar@@ d@@ wal@@ k, my kids got invol@@ v@@ ed, my do@@ g got invol@@ v@@ ed, and we created this.    
 This is called the E@@ ye@@ W@@ r@@ it@@ er, and you can see the descri@@ p@@ tion.    
 This is a chea@@ p pa@@ ir of sun@@ g@@ las@@ ses that we b@@ ought at the V@@ en@@ ice Be@@ ach bo@@ ar@@ d@@ wal@@ k, some cop@@ per wi@@ re and some stuff from H@@ ome D@@ e@@ po@@ t and R@@ a@@ di@@ o S@@ ha@@ c@@ k.    
 We took a P@@ S@@ 3 camer@@ a, ha@@ c@@ ked it op@@ en, moun@@ ted it to an L@@ E@@ D li@@ ght, and now there's a de@@ vice that is free -- you build this your@@ self, we publi@@ sh the code for fre@@ e, you down@@ lo@@ ad the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are for fre@@ e.    
 And now we've created a de@@ vice that has absolutely no lim@@ it@@ a@@ tions.    
 There's no in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce company that can say "@@ No@@ ."    
 There's no hosp@@ ital that can say "@@ No@@ ."    
 An@@ y@@ body who's par@@ aly@@ zed now has acc@@ ess to actually dra@@ w or communic@@ ate using only their ey@@ es.    
   Thank you.    
 Thank you guys very much. That was aw@@ es@@ om@@ e.    
 So at the end of the two wee@@ ks, we went back to TE@@ M@@ P@@ T@@ 's room.    
 I love this pic@@ ture, because this is someone el@@ se@@ 's room and that's his room.    
 So there's all this hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le going on for the big un@@ ve@@ il@@ ing.    
 And after over a year of plan@@ ning, two weeks of progr@@ am@@ m@@ ing, car@@ b@@ -@@ f@@ est and all@@ -@@ ni@@ ght ses@@ sion@@ s, T@@ on@@ y dre@@ w again for the first time in seven years.    
 And this is an amazing pic@@ ture, because this is his life supp@@ ort system@@ , and he's looking over his life supp@@ ort system.    
 We k@@ ic@@ ked his bed so that he could see out.    
 on a w@@ all out in the par@@ king lot outside of his hosp@@ it@@ al.    
 And he dre@@ w again for the first time, in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the par@@ king lot was@@ .    
 The fun@@ ny thing was, we had to break into the par@@ king lot to@@ o, so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scen@@ e too@@ .    
   So at the end of this, he sent us an e@@ ma@@ il, and this is what the e@@ ma@@ il said@@ : "@@ That was the first time I've dra@@ w@@ n anything for seven years.    
 I feel like I had been hel@@ d under@@ wat@@ er, and someone finally reach@@ ed down and pul@@ led my head up so I could brea@@ the@@ ."    
 I@@ s@@ n't that aw@@ es@@ ome@@ ?    
   So that's kind of our bat@@ tle cr@@ y.    
 That's what keep@@ s us going and keep@@ s us develop@@ ing.    
 And we've got such a long way to go with this.    
 This is an amazing de@@ vic@@ e, but it's the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of an E@@ t@@ ch A S@@ ke@@ t@@ ch.    
 And someone who has that kind of arti@@ sti@@ c potential deser@@ ves so much more.    
 So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it bet@@ ter, fa@@ st@@ er, str@@ ong@@ er.    
 S@@ in@@ ce that time, we've had all kinds of ac@@ knowle@@ dg@@ ment.    
 We've w@@ on a bunch of a@@ war@@ ds.    
 Re@@ memb@@ er, it's free@@ ; n@@ one of us are making any money on this thing.    
 It's all coming out of our own po@@ c@@ ke@@ ts.    
 So the a@@ wards were like, "O@@ h, this is f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic@@ ."    
 Ar@@ m@@ strong T@@ wit@@ tered about us, and then in D@@ ec@@ em@@ b@@ er, T@@ i@@ me mag@@ az@@ ine hon@@ ore@@ d us as one of the top 50 inv@@ en@@ tions of 20@@ 10@@ , which was really co@@ ol@@ .    
   The co@@ ol@@ est thing about this -- and this is what's comple@@ ting the whole cir@@ cle -- is that in A@@ pri@@ l of this year, at the G@@ eff@@ en M@@ O@@ C@@ A in down@@ town L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es, there's going to be an ex@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion called "@@ Ar@@ t of the S@@ tre@@ et@@ s."    
 And "@@ Ar@@ t of the S@@ tre@@ et@@ s@@ " is going to have pretty much the b@@ ad@@ -@@ as@@ ses of the stre@@ et art scen@@ e -- B@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ y, S@@ he@@ par@@ d F@@ ai@@ re@@ y, K@@ A@@ W@@ S -- all of these guys will be there.    
 TE@@ M@@ P@@ T@@ 's going to be in the sh@@ ow, which is pretty aw@@ es@@ om@@ e.    
   So basically this is my poin@@ t@@ : If you see something that's not possib@@ le, make it possib@@ le.    
 Every@@ thing in this room wasn't possible -- this st@@ age, this compu@@ ter, this mic@@ , the E@@ ye@@ W@@ r@@ it@@ er -- wasn't possible at one poin@@ t.    
 Ma@@ ke it possib@@ le, everyone in this room.    
 I'm not a progr@@ am@@ m@@ er, never done anything with o@@ cu@@ lar recog@@ ni@@ tion technology, but I just recog@@ n@@ ized something and as@@ soci@@ ated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen@@ .    
 And this is the question I want everyone to ask your@@ self every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be don@@ e: if not now, then wh@@ en@@ ? And if not me, then who@@ ?    
 Thank you gu@@ y@@ s.    
 I have spent the past few years putting myself into situ@@ ations that are usually very difficult and at the same time some@@ what danger@@ ous.    
 I went to pri@@ son -- diffic@@ ul@@ t.    
 I worked in a coal m@@ ine -- danger@@ ous.    
 I fil@@ med in wa@@ r z@@ ones -- difficult and danger@@ ous.    
 And I spent 30 days e@@ ating nothing but this -- fu@@ n in the begin@@ ning, little difficult in the m@@ idd@@ le, very danger@@ ous in the en@@ d.    
 In fact, most of my care@@ er, I've been im@@ mer@@ sing myself into seem@@ ingly hor@@ ri@@ ble situ@@ ations for the whole goal of trying to exam@@ ine societ@@ al issu@@ es that hop@@ e@@ fully break them down in a way that make them enter@@ tain@@ ing and acc@@ es@@ sible to an audi@@ ence.    
 So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED T@@ al@@ k that was going to look at the world of bran@@ ding and spon@@ sor@@ shi@@ p, I knew I would want to do something a little differ@@ ent.    
 So as some of you may or may not have hear@@ d, a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on e@@ B@@ a@@ y.    
 I sent out some F@@ ace@@ book messa@@ g@@ es, some T@@ wit@@ ter messa@@ g@@ es, and I gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 20@@ 1@@ 1 TED T@@ al@@ k.    
   That's right, some luck@@ y individu@@ al, cor@@ por@@ ation, for@@ -@@ prof@@ it or n@@ on-@@ prof@@ it, was going to get the on@@ c@@ e-@@ in@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ life@@ time opportunity -- because I'm sure Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you're watching right now, that at the time didn't have a ti@@ t@@ le, didn't really have a lot of cont@@ ent and didn't really give much h@@ in@@ t as to what the subjec@@ t matter would actually be.    
 So what you were getting was this: Y@@ our name here present@@ s: My TED T@@ al@@ k that you have no idea what the subjec@@ t is and, dep@@ ending on the cont@@ ent, could ultim@@ ately b@@ low up in your fac@@ e, especially if I make you or your company look stu@@ pi@@ d for doing it.    
 But that being said, it's a very good media opportun@@ ity.    
   You know how many people watch these TED T@@ al@@ k@@ s?    
 It's a lo@@ t.    
 That's just a working ti@@ t@@ le, by the way.    
   So even with that ca@@ ve@@ at, I knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing ri@@ ght@@ s.    
 Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certain@@ ty.    
 But in the new project that I'm working on, my new fil@@ m, we exam@@ ine the world of marke@@ ting, ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ing.    
 And as I said earli@@ er, I put myself in some pretty hor@@ ri@@ ble situ@@ ations over the years, but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me, nothing could ready me, for anything as difficult or as danger@@ ous as going into the room@@ s with these gu@@ y@@ s.    
   You see, I had this idea for a movi@@ e.    
  M@@ org@@ an S@@ pur@@ loc@@ k@@ : What I want to do is make a film all about produc@@ t plac@@ em@@ ent, marke@@ ting and ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ing, where the entire film is fund@@ ed by produc@@ t plac@@ em@@ ent, marke@@ ting and ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ing.    
 So the movie will be called "The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver S@@ old@@ ."    
 So what happens in "The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver S@@ old@@ ," is that everything from top to bo@@ t@@ tom@@ , from start to fin@@ ish@@ , is bran@@ ded from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ ti@@ tle spon@@ s@@ or that you'll see in the movi@@ e, which is brand X@@ .    
 Now this bran@@ d, the Q@@ u@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ ta@@ di@@ u@@ m, the S@@ ta@@ ples C@@ ent@@ er ...    
 these people will be married to the film in per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity -- fore@@ ver.    
 And so the film explo@@ res this whole idea -- It's what@@ ? In per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity, fore@@ ver@@ ?    
 I'm a re@@ d@@ und@@ ant pers@@ on. That was more for emp@@ ha@@ si@@ s.    
 It was, "@@ In per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ity. F@@ ore@@ ver@@ ."    
 But not only are we going to have the brand X ti@@ tle spon@@ sor@@ , but we're going to make sure we sel@@ l out every categor@@ y we can in the fil@@ m.    
 So maybe we sel@@ l a sho@@ e and it becomes the greatest sho@@ e you ever wor@@ e ...    
 the greatest car you ever dro@@ ve from "The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver S@@ old@@ ," the greatest d@@ rin@@ k you've ever ha@@ d, cour@@ tes@@ y of "The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver S@@ old@@ ."    
 X@@ a@@ vi@@ er K@@ o@@ ch@@ har@@ : So the idea is, beyond just showing that bran@@ ds are a part of your life, but actually get them to fin@@ ance the fil@@ m@@ ? MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.    
 The goal of this whole film is transp@@ aren@@ c@@ y.    
 You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movi@@ e.    
 So that's the whole concep@@ t, the whole fil@@ m, start to fin@@ ish@@ .    
 And I would love for C@@ E@@ G to help make it happen@@ .    
 R@@ ob@@ er@@ t Fri@@ ed@@ man@@ : You know it's fun@@ n@@ y, because when I first hear it, it is the ultim@@ ate res@@ pect for an audi@@ ence. G@@ u@@ y@@ : I don't know how rec@@ ep@@ tive people are going to be to it, thou@@ gh@@ .    
 X@@ K@@ : Do you have a perspec@@ tive -- I don't want to use "@@ ang@@ le@@ " because that has a nega@@ tive con@@ no@@ ta@@ tion -- but do you know how this is going to play out@@ ? D@@ a@@ vi@@ d Co@@ h@@ n@@ : How much money does it take to do this?    
 MS: 1@@ .@@ 5 milli@@ on. Jo@@ h@@ n K@@ am@@ en@@ : I think that you're going to have a hard time me@@ e@@ ting with them, but I think it's certainly worth pur@@ su@@ ing X@@ K@@ : Who know@@ s, maybe by the time your film comes out, we look like a bunch of b@@ li@@ ther@@ ing i@@ di@@ o@@ ts.    
 MS: What do you think the respon@@ se is going to be@@ ?    
 S@@ tu@@ art R@@ u@@ der@@ fer@@ : The respon@@ ses mo@@ st@@ ly will be "@@ no@@ ."    
 MS: But is it a tou@@ gh sel@@ l because of the film or a tou@@ gh sel@@ l because of me@@ ?    
 J@@ K@@ : B@@ o@@ th.    
 MS: ... M@@ e@@ an@@ ing not so op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic.    
 So, si@@ r@@ , can you help me@@ ? I need hel@@ p.    
 M@@ K@@ : I can help you.    
 MS: Oka@@ y. A@@ w@@ es@@ om@@ e.    
 M@@ K@@ : We've go@@ tt@@ a figure out which bran@@ ds.    
 MS: Yea@@ h. When you look at the people you deal with .@@ .    
 M@@ K@@ : We've got some places we can go. T@@ ur@@ n the camera off.    
 MS: I thought "@@ T@@ ur@@ n the camera off@@ " mean@@ t, "@@ Let's have an off@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ rec@@ ord conversa@@ tion@@ ."    
 T@@ ur@@ ns out it really mean@@ s, "@@ We want nothing to do with your movi@@ e."    
 MS: And just like that, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disap@@ pe@@ are@@ d.    
 N@@ one of them wanted anything to do with this movi@@ e.    
 I was ama@@ z@@ ed.    
 They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this projec@@ t.    
 And I was b@@ low@@ n away, because I thought the whole concep@@ t, the idea of ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ing, was to get your produc@@ t out in front of as many people as possib@@ le, to get as many people to see it as possib@@ le.    
 E@@ speci@@ ally in to@@ da@@ y's world, this inter@@ se@@ c@@ tion of new media and old media and the f@@ r@@ actu@@ red media lan@@ ds@@ cap@@ e, isn't the idea to get that new bu@@ z@@ z@@ -@@ wor@@ th@@ y deli@@ very ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le that's going to get that messa@@ ge to the mas@@ s@@ es?    
 No, that's what I thou@@ ght.    
 But the problem was, you see, my idea had one f@@ at@@ al f@@ law@@ , and that fla@@ w was this.    
 A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally no@@ , that was not the fla@@ w what@@ so@@ ever@@ .    
 That wouldn't have been a problem at all.    
 This would have been fin@@ e.    
 But what this image re@@ pres@@ ents was the problem.    
 Se@@ e, when you do a Goog@@ le image se@@ arch for transp@@ aren@@ c@@ y, this is -@@ -- This is one of the first images that comes up.    
 So I like the way you ro@@ ll@@ , S@@ er@@ ge@@ y B@@ rin@@ . No@@ .    
   This is was the problem@@ : transp@@ aren@@ c@@ y -- free from pret@@ en@@ se or dec@@ e@@ it@@ ; eas@@ ily de@@ te@@ c@@ ted or seen through@@ ; rea@@ di@@ ly underst@@ oo@@ d@@ ; charac@@ ter@@ ized by vi@@ sib@@ ility or acc@@ es@@ sib@@ ility of informa@@ tion, especially con@@ cer@@ ning business prac@@ tic@@ es -- that last line being probably the biggest problem.    
 You see, we hear a lot about transp@@ aren@@ c@@ y these day@@ s.    
 Our poli@@ tici@@ ans say it, our pres@@ id@@ ent says it, even our C@@ E@@ O@@ 's say it.    
 But suddenly when it comes down to be@@ coming a real@@ ity, something suddenly chang@@ es.    
 But wh@@ y? Well, transp@@ aren@@ c@@ y is sc@@ ary -- like that o@@ d@@ d, sti@@ ll@@ -@@ scre@@ am@@ ing be@@ ar@@ .    
   It's un@@ pre@@ dic@@ table -- like this o@@ d@@ d country roa@@ d.    
 And it's also very risk@@ y.    
   What else is risk@@ y?    
 E@@ ating an entire bo@@ w@@ l of C@@ ool Wh@@ i@@ p.    
   That's very risk@@ y.    
 Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "@@ No, we want you to tell a story.    
 We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our stor@@ y."    
 Se@@ e, when I was a kid and my father would cat@@ ch me in some sort of a li@@ e -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say, "@@ S@@ on, there's three sid@@ es to every story.    
 There's your story, there's my story and there's the real stor@@ y."    
 Now you see, with this fil@@ m, we wanted to tell the real story.    
 But with only one compan@@ y, one ag@@ ency willing to help me -- and that's only because I knew Jo@@ h@@ n B@@ ond and Ri@@ ch@@ ard K@@ ir@@ sh@@ en@@ b@@ au@@ m for years -- I realized that I would have to go on my ow@@ n, I'd have to c@@ ut out the m@@ idd@@ le@@ man and go to the companies myself with all of my te@@ am.    
 So what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having conversa@@ tions with these comp@@ ani@@ es, the idea of understanding your brand is a uni@@ vers@@ al problem.    
  MS: I have friends who make great bi@@ g, gi@@ ant Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood fil@@ ms, and I have friends who make little in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent fil@@ ms like I ma@@ k@@ e.    
 And the friends of m@@ ine who make bi@@ g, gi@@ ant Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood movi@@ es say the reason their fil@@ ms are so success@@ ful is because of the brand part@@ n@@ ers that they ha@@ ve.    
 And then my friends who make small in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent fil@@ ms say, "Well, how are we supposed to compe@@ te with these bi@@ g, gi@@ ant Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood movi@@ es@@ ?"    
 And the movie is called "The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver S@@ old@@ ."    
 So how speci@@ fic@@ ally will we see B@@ an in the fil@@ m@@ ?    
 An@@ y time I'm ready to go@@ , any time I open up my medic@@ ine ca@@ b@@ ine@@ t, you will see B@@ an de@@ o@@ d@@ or@@ ant.    
 Wh@@ i@@ le any@@ time I do an inter@@ view with some@@ one, I can say, "A@@ re you f@@ res@@ h enough for this inter@@ view@@ ?    
 Are you read@@ y? You look a little ner@@ v@@ ous.    
 I want to help you cal@@ m dow@@ n.    
 So maybe you should put some one before the inter@@ view@@ ."    
 So we@@ 'll offer one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous sc@@ ents.    
 Wh@@ e@@ ther it's a "@@ F@@ l@@ or@@ al F@@ usi@@ on@@ " or a "@@ Par@@ a@@ di@@ se W@@ in@@ ds@@ ," they@@ 'll have their chan@@ ce.    
 We will have them ge@@ ared for both male or fe@@ male -- so@@ li@@ d, ro@@ ll@@ -@@ on or s@@ tic@@ k, what@@ ever it may be.    
 That's the tw@@ o@@ -@@ c@@ ent t@@ our@@ .    
 So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the fi@@ ve@@ -@@ c@@ ent t@@ our@@ .    
 K@@ are@@ n Fran@@ k@@ : We are a sm@@ all@@ er bran@@ d.    
 M@@ uch like you talked about being a sm@@ all@@ er movi@@ e, we're very much a challeng@@ er bran@@ d.    
 So we don't have the bu@@ d@@ gets that other bran@@ ds ha@@ ve.    
 So doing things like this -- you know, re@@ mind people about B@@ an -- is kind of why were interested in it.    
 MS: What are the words that you would use to descri@@ be B@@ an@@ ?    
 B@@ an is b@@ lan@@ k.    
 K@@ F@@ : That's a great ques@@ tion.    
   W@@ om@@ an@@ : Su@@ peri@@ or technolog@@ y.    
 MS: T@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ log@@ y's not the way you want to descri@@ be something some@@ bod@@ y's putting in their ar@@ mp@@ it.    
 Man@@ : We talk about b@@ old, fre@@ sh@@ .    
 I think "@@ fre@@ sh@@ " is a great word that really sp@@ ins this categor@@ y into the posi@@ tive, ver@@ su@@ s "@@ fi@@ ghts o@@ d@@ or and we@@ t@@ n@@ ess@@ ."    
 It keep@@ s you fre@@ sh@@ .    
 How do we keep you fre@@ sh@@ er longer -- better fre@@ sh@@ ness, more fre@@ sh@@ ness, three times fre@@ sh@@ er.    
 Th@@ ings like that that are more of that posi@@ tive bene@@ f@@ it.    
 MS: And that's a multi@@ -@@ million dol@@ lar cor@@ por@@ ation.    
 What about me@@ ? What about a re@@ gu@@ lar gu@@ y?    
 I need to go talk to the man on the stree@@ t, the people who are like me, the re@@ gu@@ lar Jo@@ es.    
 They need to tell me about my bran@@ d.    
  MS: How would you guys descri@@ be your bran@@ d?    
 Man@@ : U@@ m, my bran@@ d?    
 I don't know.    
 I like really n@@ ice clo@@ th@@ es.    
 W@@ om@@ an@@ : 80@@ 's re@@ vi@@ v@@ al me@@ e@@ ts sk@@ at@@ er@@ -@@ p@@ un@@ k, un@@ less it's la@@ und@@ ry day.    
 MS: All right, what is brand Ger@@ r@@ y?    
 Ger@@ r@@ y@@ : U@@ ni@@ qu@@ e. Man@@ : I gu@@ ess what kind of gen@@ re, st@@ y@@ le I am would be like dar@@ k g@@ l@@ am@@ or.    
 I like a lot of black color@@ s, a lot of gra@@ ys and stuff like that.    
 But usually I have an acc@@ ess@@ or@@ y, like sun@@ g@@ las@@ s@@ es, or I like cr@@ y@@ st@@ al and things like that too@@ .    
 W@@ om@@ an@@ : If D@@ an were a bran@@ d, he might be a clas@@ si@@ c conver@@ ti@@ ble M@@ er@@ c@@ ed@@ es B@@ en@@ z@@ .    
 M@@ an 2@@ : The brand that I am is, I would call it ca@@ su@@ al fl@@ y.    
 W@@ om@@ an 2@@ : Par@@ t hi@@ pp@@ i@@ e, part y@@ o@@ gi@@ , part B@@ roo@@ k@@ ly@@ n girl -- I don't know.    
 M@@ an 3@@ : I'm the pe@@ t gu@@ y.    
 I sel@@ l pe@@ t to@@ ys all over the countr@@ y, all over the world.    
 So I gu@@ ess that's my bran@@ d.    
 In my war@@ ped little indu@@ str@@ y, that's my bran@@ d.    
 M@@ an 4@@ : My brand is F@@ ed@@ E@@ x because I deli@@ ver the goo@@ ds.    
 M@@ an 5@@ : F@@ a@@ il@@ ed writ@@ er@@ -@@ al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ c bran@@ d.    
 Is that some@@ thing@@ ?    
 L@@ aw@@ y@@ er@@ : I'm a law@@ y@@ er bran@@ d.    
 T@@ om@@ : I'm T@@ om@@ .    
 MS: Well we can't all be brand T@@ om@@ , but I do often find myself at the inter@@ se@@ c@@ tion of dar@@ k g@@ l@@ am@@ or and ca@@ su@@ al fl@@ y.    
   And what I realized is I needed an exper@@ t.    
 somebody who could really help me understand what they call your "@@ brand person@@ al@@ it@@ y."    
 And so I found a company called O@@ l@@ son Z@@ al@@ t@@ man in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ g@@ .    
 The@@ y@@ 've helped companies like N@@ est@@ le, F@@ eb@@ re@@ z@@ e, H@@ all@@ mar@@ k dis@@ co@@ ver that brand person@@ al@@ ity.    
 If they could do it for them, su@@ rely they could do it for me.    
  A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il@@ : You brought your pic@@ tures, right?    
 MS: I di@@ d. The very first picture is a picture of my famil@@ y.    
 A: So tell me a little bit how it re@@ lat@@ es to your thou@@ ghts and feel@@ ings about who you are.    
 MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.    
 A: T@@ ell me about this world.    
 MS: This worl@@ d? I think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the job you do.    
 All those things stem@@ med and started from one plac@@ e, and for me they stem@@ med and started with my family in W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a.    
 A: What's the next one you want to talk ab@@ out@@ ?    
 MS: The next one@@ : This was the best day ever@@ .    
 A: How does this rel@@ ate to your thou@@ ghts and feel@@ ings about who you are@@ ?    
 MS: It's like, who do I want to be@@ ?    
 I like things that are differ@@ ent.    
 I like things that are we@@ ir@@ d. I like we@@ ird things.    
 A: T@@ ell me about the "@@ wh@@ y@@ " p@@ ha@@ se -- what does that do for us@@ ?    
 What is the m@@ ac@@ he@@ te@@ ? What pu@@ p@@ a st@@ age are you in now@@ ?    
 Why is it important to re@@ boo@@ t? What does the red represent@@ ?    
 T@@ ell me a little bit about that par@@ t.    
 ... A little more about you that is not who you are.    
 What are some other me@@ t@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ os@@ es that you've ha@@ d?    
 ... Do@@ es@@ n't have to be fear@@ . What kind of ro@@ ll@@ er co@@ a@@ ster are you on@@ ?    
 MS: E@@ E@@ E@@ E@@ E@@ E@@ ! No, th@@ ank you.    
 A: Th@@ an@@ ks for you pati@@ ence. A: Yea@@ h. All right.    
 MS: Yea@@ h, I don't know what's going to come of this.    
 There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.    
 L@@ in@@ d@@ say Z@@ al@@ t@@ man@@ : The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two dist@@ inc@@ t, but comple@@ ment@@ ary sid@@ es to your brand person@@ ality -- the M@@ org@@ an S@@ pur@@ lo@@ ck brand is a mind@@ ful@@ /@@ play bran@@ d.    
 Th@@ ose are ju@@ x@@ ta@@ pos@@ ed very n@@ ic@@ ely together.    
 And I think there's almost a par@@ a@@ do@@ x with th@@ os@@ e.    
 And I think some companies will just foc@@ us on one of their st@@ ren@@ g@@ th@@ s or the other instead of foc@@ using on bo@@ th.    
 M@@ ost companies t@@ end to -- and it's human nature -- to a@@ vo@@ id things that they're not sure of, a@@ vo@@ id fear@@ , those el@@ em@@ ents, and you really em@@ br@@ ace th@@ os@@ e, and you actually turn them into posi@@ tiv@@ es for you, and it's a ne@@ at thing to se@@ e.    
 What other bran@@ ds are like that?    
 The first on here is the clas@@ sic@@ , A@@ pp@@ le.    
 And you can see here to@@ o, T@@ ar@@ ge@@ t, Wi@@ i@@ , M@@ in@@ i from the M@@ in@@ i Co@@ op@@ ers, and J@@ et@@ B@@ lu@@ e.    
 Now there's play@@ ful bran@@ ds and mind@@ ful bran@@ ds, those things that have come and g@@ one, but a play@@ ful, mind@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing.    
 MS: A play@@ ful, mind@@ ful bran@@ d. What is your bran@@ d?    
 If somebody asked you to descri@@ be your brand identi@@ ty, your brand person@@ al@@ ity, what would you be@@ ?    
 Are you an up at@@ tribu@@ te@@ ? Are you something that gets the blood flow@@ ing?    
 Or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te@@ ?    
 Are you something that's a little more cal@@ m, res@@ er@@ v@@ ed, con@@ ser@@ va@@ tiv@@ e?    
 U@@ p at@@ tribu@@ tes are things like being play@@ ful, being f@@ res@@ h like the F@@ res@@ h P@@ rin@@ ce, contemp@@ or@@ ar@@ y, ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rou@@ s, ed@@ g@@ y or dar@@ ing like E@@ r@@ ro@@ l F@@ ly@@ n@@ n, ni@@ mb@@ le or ag@@ i@@ le, prof@@ an@@ e, dom@@ ine@@ er@@ ing, ma@@ gi@@ cal or my@@ sti@@ cal like G@@ an@@ d@@ al@@ f@@ .    
 Or are you more of a down at@@ tribu@@ te@@ ?    
 Are you mind@@ ful, s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated like 00@@ 7@@ ?    
 Are you es@@ tab@@ li@@ sh@@ ed, tra@@ di@@ tion@@ al, n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing, prote@@ c@@ tive, emp@@ a@@ the@@ tic like the O@@ p@@ ra@@ h@@ ?    
 Are you reli@@ able, st@@ able, famili@@ ar, contemp@@ la@@ tive or w@@ ise like the D@@ al@@ a@@ i L@@ am@@ a or Y@@ o@@ da@@ ?    
 O@@ ver the course of this fil@@ m, who were up and down companies say@@ ing, "@@ no@@ ," they didn't want any part of this projec@@ t.    
 They wanted nothing to do with this fil@@ m, main@@ ly because they would have no contro@@ l@@ , they would have no control over the fin@@ al produc@@ t.    
 But we did get 1@@ 7 brand part@@ n@@ ers who were willing to re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish that contro@@ l@@ , who wanted to be in business with someone as mind@@ ful and as play@@ ful as myself and who ultim@@ ately em@@ power@@ ed us to tell stories that nor@@ m@@ ally we wouldn't be able to tell -- stories that an ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ er would nor@@ m@@ ally never get beh@@ in@@ d.    
 They en@@ ab@@ led us to tell the story about ne@@ ur@@ om@@ ar@@ ke@@ ting, as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using M@@ R@@ I@@ 's to target the des@@ i@@ re cent@@ ers of your brain for both comm@@ er@@ ci@@ als as well as movie marke@@ t@@ ing.    
 We went to S@@ an P@@ a@@ ul@@ o where they have ban@@ ned out@@ door ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ing.    
 In the entire city for the past five years, there's no b@@ ill@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds, there's no po@@ ster@@ s, there's no fl@@ y@@ ers, no@@ thing.    
   And we went to school di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts where now companies are making their way into ca@@ sh@@ -@@ stra@@ pped school@@ s all across Ameri@@ ca@@ .    
 What's incredi@@ ble for me is the projec@@ ts that I've gotten the most fe@@ ed@@ back out of, or I've had the most success in, are ones where I've interac@@ ted with things direc@@ t@@ ly.    
 And that's what these bran@@ ds di@@ d.    
 They c@@ ut out the m@@ idd@@ le@@ man, they c@@ ut out their ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es and said, "@@ Maybe these ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es don't have my best inter@@ est in min@@ d.    
 I'm going to deal direc@@ tly with the arti@@ st.    
 I'm going to work with him to create something differ@@ ent, something that's going to get people thinking, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world@@ ."    
 And how has that been for them@@ ? H@@ as it been success@@ ful@@ ?    
 Well, since the film pre@@ mi@@ ered at the S@@ und@@ ance F@@ il@@ m F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al, let's take a loo@@ k.    
 A@@ cc@@ or@@ ding to B@@ ur@@ rel@@ l@@ es, the movie pre@@ mi@@ ered in J@@ an@@ u@@ ar@@ y, and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing -- we've had 9@@ 00 million media imp@@ res@@ sions for this fil@@ m.    
 That's literally cover@@ ing just like a two and a hal@@ f@@ -@@ week peri@@ o@@ d.    
 That's only online -- no prin@@ t, no T@@ V@@ .    
 The film ha@@ s@@ n't even been di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ted ye@@ t.    
 It's not even on@@ lin@@ e. It's not even stre@@ am@@ ing.    
 It's not even been out into other fore@@ ign countries ye@@ t.    
 So ultim@@ ately, this film has already started to ga@@ in a lot of mom@@ en@@ tu@@ m.    
 And not bad for a project that almost every ad ag@@ ency we talked to adv@@ is@@ ed their cli@@ ents not to take par@@ t.    
 What I always believe is that if you take chan@@ c@@ es, if you take risk@@ s, that in those ris@@ ks will come opportun@@ ity.    
 I believe that when you pus@@ h people away from that, you're push@@ ing them more towards fail@@ u@@ re.    
 I believe that when you tra@@ in your emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es to be ris@@ k aver@@ se, then you're pre@@ par@@ ing your whole company to be re@@ ward challen@@ ge@@ d.    
 I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to en@@ courage people to take risk@@ s.    
 We need to en@@ courage people to not be afraid of oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties that may sc@@ are them.    
 U@@ l@@ tim@@ ately, moving for@@ war@@ d, I think we have to em@@ br@@ ace fear@@ .    
 We've got to put that be@@ ar in a ca@@ g@@ e.    
   E@@ mb@@ rac@@ e fear@@ . E@@ mb@@ rac@@ e ris@@ k.    
 One big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time, we have to em@@ br@@ ace ris@@ k.    
 And ultim@@ ately, we have to em@@ br@@ ace transp@@ aren@@ c@@ y. To@@ day, more than ever@@ , a little hon@@ es@@ ty is going to go a long way.    
 And that being said, through hon@@ es@@ ty and transp@@ aren@@ c@@ y, my entire tal@@ k, "@@ E@@ mb@@ rac@@ e T@@ ran@@ sp@@ aren@@ cy@@ ," has been brought to you by my good friends at E@@ M@@ C@@ , who for $@@ 7@@ ,@@ 100 b@@ ought the nam@@ ing rights on e@@ B@@ a@@ y.    
   E@@ M@@ C@@ : T@@ ur@@ ning big data into big opportunity for organ@@ iz@@ ations all over the world.    
 E@@ M@@ C present@@ s: "@@ E@@ mb@@ rac@@ e T@@ ran@@ sp@@ aren@@ c@@ y."    
 Thank you very mu@@ ch, gu@@ y@@ s.    
   J@@ un@@ e Co@@ h@@ en@@ : So, M@@ org@@ an, in the name of transp@@ aren@@ c@@ y, what exactly happened to that $@@ 7@@ ,@@ 1@@ 00@@ ?    
 MS: That is a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic ques@@ tion.    
 I have in my po@@ c@@ ket a chec@@ k made out to the paren@@ t organ@@ iz@@ ation to the TED organ@@ iz@@ ation, the S@@ a@@ pl@@ ing F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion -- a chec@@ k for $@@ 7@@ ,@@ 100 to be appli@@ ed tow@@ ard my att@@ end@@ ance for next year@@ 's TED@@ .    
 The idea behind the S@@ tu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually quite simp@@ le.    
 We don't want I@@ r@@ an to get the b@@ om@@ b@@ .    
 The@@ ir maj@@ or as@@ set for develop@@ ing nuc@@ le@@ ar we@@ ap@@ ons is the N@@ at@@ an@@ z ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ment fac@@ ility.    
 The gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ es that you see, these are real@@ -@@ time control system@@ s.    
 Now if we man@@ age to comp@@ rom@@ ise these systems that control dri@@ ve spe@@ eds and val@@ ves, we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ e.    
 The gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ es don't run W@@ in@@ dow@@ s so@@ f@@ t@@ wa@@ re@@ ; they are a completely different technolog@@ y.    
 But if we man@@ age to place a good W@@ in@@ dow@@ s vir@@ us on a no@@ te@@ book that is used by a main@@ ten@@ ance engine@@ er to con@@ figure this gra@@ y bo@@ x, then we are in busin@@ ess.    
 And this is the p@@ lot behind S@@ tu@@ x@@ ne@@ t.    
 So we start with a W@@ in@@ dow@@ s dro@@ p@@ per@@ .    
 The pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad goes onto the gra@@ y bo@@ x, da@@ mag@@ es the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ e, and the I@@ ran@@ ian nuc@@ le@@ ar program is del@@ a@@ yed -- mis@@ sion ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ed.    
 That's eas@@ y, hu@@ h@@ ?    
 I want to tell you how we found that out.    
 When we started our research on S@@ tu@@ x@@ net six months ago, it was completely un@@ known what the pur@@ p@@ ose of this thing was@@ .    
 The only thing that was known is it's very, very complex on the W@@ in@@ dow@@ s par@@ t, the dro@@ pp@@ er par@@ t, used multi@@ ple zer@@ o@@ -@@ day vul@@ ner@@ ab@@ ili@@ ties.    
 And it seemed to want to do something with these gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ es, these real@@ -@@ time control system@@ s.    
 So that got our att@@ en@@ tion, and we started a la@@ b project where we in@@ fec@@ ted our environment with S@@ tu@@ x@@ net and chec@@ ked this thing out.    
 And then some very fun@@ ny things happen@@ ed.    
 S@@ tu@@ x@@ net beha@@ ved like a la@@ b r@@ at that didn't like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed, but didn't want to e@@ at.    
 D@@ id@@ n't make sense to me.    
 And after we experi@@ mented with different fla@@ v@@ ors of che@@ es@@ e, I real@@ iz@@ ed, well, this is a direc@@ ted att@@ ac@@ k.    
 It's completely direc@@ ted.    
 The dro@@ pp@@ er is pro@@ w@@ ling ac@@ tively on the gra@@ y bo@@ x if a speci@@ fic con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tion is foun@@ d, and even if the actu@@ al program code that it's trying to in@@ fec@@ t is actually run@@ ning on that tar@@ ge@@ t.    
 And if not, S@@ tu@@ x@@ net does no@@ thing.    
 So that really got my att@@ en@@ tion, and we started to work on this nearly around the clo@@ c@@ k, because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.    
 It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plan@@ t, or a chemical plant in Ger@@ man@@ y.    
 So we better find out what the target is so@@ on@@ ."    
 So we ex@@ trac@@ ted and de@@ comp@@ il@@ ed the att@@ ack co@@ de, and we discover@@ ed that it's struc@@ ture@@ d in two digital b@@ om@@ b@@ s -- a sm@@ all@@ er one and a bigg@@ er one.    
 And we also saw that they are very prof@@ es@@ sion@@ ally engine@@ ered by people who obvi@@ ously had all insid@@ er information.    
 They knew all the b@@ its and b@@ it@@ es that they had to att@@ ac@@ k.    
 They probably even know the sho@@ e si@@ ze of the oper@@ at@@ or.    
 So they know every@@ thing.    
 And if you have heard that the dro@@ pp@@ er of S@@ tu@@ x@@ net is complex and high@@ -@@ tech@@ , let me tell you this: the pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad is ro@@ c@@ ket sci@@ ence.    
 It's way abo@@ ve everything that we have ever seen before.    
 Here you see a sam@@ ple of this actu@@ al att@@ ack co@@ de.    
 We are talking about -- around about 1@@ 5@@ ,000 lin@@ es of co@@ de.    
 L@@ oo@@ ks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ st@@ y@@ le as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly langu@@ age.    
 And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this co@@ de.    
 So what we were looking for is, first of all, system fun@@ c@@ tion call@@ s, because we know what they do.    
 And then we were looking for tim@@ ers and data struc@@ tures and trying to rel@@ ate them to the real world -- to potential real world tar@@ ge@@ ts.    
 So we do need target theor@@ ies that we can pro@@ ve or dis@@ pro@@ ve.    
 In order to get target the@@ ori@@ es, we remember that it's defin@@ it@@ ely har@@ d@@ cor@@ e s@@ abo@@ ta@@ g@@ e, it must be a high@@ -@@ value target and it is most likely loc@@ ated in I@@ ran@@ , because that's where most of the in@@ fec@@ tions had been repor@@ ted.    
 Now you don't find several thous@@ and tar@@ gets in that a@@ rea@@ .    
 to the B@@ us@@ he@@ h@@ r nuc@@ le@@ ar power plant and to the N@@ at@@ an@@ z fu@@ el en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ment plan@@ t.    
 So I told my as@@ si@@ stan@@ t, "@@ G@@ et me a li@@ st of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant exper@@ ts from our cli@@ ent bas@@ e."    
 And I ph@@ on@@ ed them up and pic@@ ked their brain in an eff@@ ort to mat@@ ch their exper@@ ti@@ se with what we found in code and dat@@ a.    
 And that worked pretty well.    
 So we were able to as@@ soci@@ ate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor contro@@ l@@ .    
 The ro@@ tor is that moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ e, that black objec@@ t that you se@@ e.    
 And if you man@@ i@@ pul@@ ate the spe@@ ed of this ro@@ tor@@ , you are actually able to crac@@ k the ro@@ tor and even@@ tu@@ ally even have the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de.    
 What we also saw is that the goal of the att@@ ack was really to do it s@@ low@@ ly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obvi@@ ously in an eff@@ ort to dri@@ ve main@@ ten@@ ance engine@@ ers craz@@ y, that they would not be able to figure this out quick@@ ly.    
 The big digital war@@ head -- we had a sho@@ t at this by looking very clo@@ sel@@ y at data and data struc@@ ture@@ s.    
 So for example, the number 1@@ 6@@ 4 really stan@@ ds out in that co@@ de@@ ; you can't over@@ look it.    
 I started to research scientific liter@@ atu@@ re on how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ es are actually built in N@@ at@@ an@@ z and found they are struc@@ ture@@ d in what is called a cas@@ ca@@ de, and each cas@@ ca@@ de hol@@ ds 1@@ 6@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ es.    
 So that made sen@@ se, that was a mat@@ ch.    
 And it even got better.    
 These cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ es in I@@ r@@ an are sub@@ di@@ vid@@ ed into 1@@ 5@@ , what is cal@@ le@@ d, st@@ ag@@ es.    
 And gu@@ ess what we found in the att@@ ack co@@ de@@ ?    
 A@@ n almost identi@@ cal struc@@ ture.    
 So again, that was a real good mat@@ ch.    
 And this gave us very high conf@@ idence for what we were looking at.    
 Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.    
 These resul@@ ts have been ob@@ tain@@ ed over several weeks of really hard lab@@ or.    
 And we often went into just a de@@ ad end and had to re@@ cover@@ .    
 An@@ y@@ way, so we figu@@ red out that both digital war@@ head@@ s were actually a@@ im@@ ing at one and the same tar@@ ge@@ t, but from different ang@@ les.    
 The small war@@ head is taking one cas@@ ca@@ de, and sp@@ in@@ ning up the ro@@ tors and s@@ low@@ ing them dow@@ n, and the big war@@ head is talking to six cas@@ ca@@ des and man@@ i@@ pul@@ ating val@@ v@@ es.    
 So in all, we are very conf@@ id@@ ent that we have actually de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed what the target is.    
 It is N@@ at@@ an@@ z@@ , and it is only N@@ at@@ an@@ z@@ .    
 So we don't have to wor@@ ry that other tar@@ gets might be hit by S@@ tu@@ x@@ ne@@ t.    
 Here's some very c@@ ool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ c@@ ked my so@@ c@@ ks off.    
 D@@ own there is the gra@@ y bo@@ x, and on the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ es.    
 Now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the in@@ put valu@@ es from sen@@ sor@@ s -- so for example, from pres@@ sure sen@@ sor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tion sen@@ sor@@ s -- and it provid@@ es le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate program co@@ de, which is still run@@ ning during the att@@ ac@@ k, with fa@@ ke in@@ put dat@@ a.    
 And as a matter of fact, this fa@@ ke in@@ put data is actually p@@ r@@ er@@ ec@@ ord@@ ed by S@@ tu@@ x@@ ne@@ t.    
 So it's just like from the Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood movi@@ es where during the he@@ ist@@ , the ob@@ ser@@ v@@ ation camera is f@@ ed with p@@ r@@ er@@ ec@@ ord@@ ed vide@@ o.    
 That's co@@ ol@@ , hu@@ h@@ ?    
 The idea here is obvi@@ ously not only to f@@ ool the oper@@ at@@ ors in the control room.    
 It actually is much more danger@@ ous and ag@@ gres@@ si@@ ve.    
 The idea is to cir@@ cu@@ m@@ v@@ ent a digital sa@@ fe@@ ty system.    
 We need digital sa@@ fe@@ ty systems where a human oper@@ at@@ or could not act quic@@ k enou@@ gh@@ .    
 So for example, in a power plan@@ t, when your big stea@@ m tur@@ b@@ ine gets too over spe@@ ed, you must open reli@@ ef val@@ ves within a milli@@ secon@@ d.    
 O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly, this cannot be done by a human oper@@ at@@ or.    
 So this is where we need digital sa@@ fe@@ ty system@@ s.    
 And when they are comp@@ rom@@ i@@ se@@ d, then real bad things can happen@@ .    
 Y@@ our plant can b@@ low up.    
 And nei@@ ther your oper@@ at@@ ors no@@ r your sa@@ fe@@ ty system will no@@ tice it.    
 That's sc@@ ary.    
 But it gets wor@@ se.    
 And this is very import@@ ant, what I'm going to sa@@ y.    
 Th@@ ink about this: this att@@ ack is gener@@ ic.    
 It doesn't have anything to do, in speci@@ fic@@ s, with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ es, with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ment.    
 So it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an au@@ tom@@ o@@ bi@@ le fac@@ tor@@ y.    
 It is gener@@ ic.    
 And you don't have -- as an att@@ ack@@ er -- you don't have to deli@@ ver this pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad by a U@@ S@@ B s@@ tic@@ k, as we saw it in the case of S@@ tu@@ x@@ ne@@ t.    
 You could also use con@@ ven@@ tional wor@@ m technology for sp@@ read@@ ing.    
 Just sp@@ read it as w@@ ide as possib@@ le.    
 And if you do that, what you end up with is a cy@@ b@@ er we@@ ap@@ on of ma@@ ss des@@ truc@@ tion.    
 That's the consequ@@ ence that we have to fac@@ e.    
 So un@@ fortun@@ ately, the biggest number of tar@@ gets for such att@@ ac@@ ks are not in the M@@ iddle E@@ a@@ st.    
 They're in the United States and E@@ uro@@ pe and in J@@ ap@@ an.    
 So all of the gre@@ en are@@ as, these are your tar@@ ge@@ t@@ -@@ rich environ@@ ment@@ s.    
 We have to face the consequ@@ enc@@ es, and we better start to pre@@ p@@ are right now.    
 Th@@ an@@ ks.    
   Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : I've got a ques@@ tion.    
 R@@ al@@ ph@@ , it's been quite w@@ id@@ ely repor@@ ted that people as@@ su@@ me that M@@ os@@ sa@@ d is the main enti@@ ty behind this.    
 Is that your opini@@ on@@ ?    
 R@@ al@@ p@@ h L@@ ang@@ ner@@ : Oka@@ y, you really want to hear that?    
 Yea@@ h. Oka@@ y.    
 My opini@@ on is that the M@@ os@@ sa@@ d is invol@@ v@@ ed, but that the lead@@ ing for@@ ce is not I@@ s@@ ra@@ el@@ .    
 So the lead@@ ing for@@ ce behind that is the cy@@ b@@ er super@@ pow@@ er.    
 There is only one, and that's the United States -- fortun@@ ately, fortun@@ at@@ el@@ y.    
 Because other@@ wis@@ e, our problems would even be bigg@@ er.    
 CA: Thank you for sc@@ aring the living day@@ li@@ ghts out of us. Thank you, R@@ al@@ ph@@ .    
 I want you now to imagine a we@@ ar@@ able robo@@ t that gi@@ ves you super@@ human ab@@ ili@@ ties, or another one that takes whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ ers up standing and walking again.    
 We at B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey B@@ i@@ on@@ ics call these robo@@ ts ex@@ os@@ k@@ el@@ et@@ on@@ s.    
 These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning, and it will give you ex@@ tr@@ a st@@ ren@@ g@@ th, and it will f@@ ur@@ ther en@@ han@@ ce your spe@@ ed, and it will help you, for instan@@ ce, to man@@ age your bal@@ anc@@ e.    
 It is actually the tru@@ e inte@@ gra@@ tion of the man and the mach@@ ine.    
 But not only that -- it will inte@@ gr@@ ate and net@@ work you and other de@@ vic@@ es out there.    
 This is just not some bl@@ ue sk@@ y thin@@ king.    
 To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American sol@@ di@@ er, that on average does car@@ ry about 100 l@@ b@@ s. on their bac@@ ks, and they are being asked to car@@ ry more e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment.    
 O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly, this is resul@@ ting in some maj@@ or comp@@ li@@ cations -- back in@@ ju@@ ri@@ es, 30 percent of them -- ch@@ ron@@ ic back in@@ ju@@ ri@@ es.    
 So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an ex@@ os@@ k@@ el@@ et@@ on that would help deal with this issu@@ e.    
 So let me now intro@@ duce to you H@@ U@@ L@@ C -- or the H@@ u@@ man U@@ ni@@ vers@@ al L@@ o@@ ad C@@ arri@@ er.    
 S@@ ol@@ di@@ er@@ : With the H@@ U@@ L@@ C ex@@ os@@ k@@ el@@ et@@ on, I can car@@ ry 2@@ 00 l@@ b@@ s. over vari@@ ed ter@@ ra@@ in for many hour@@ s.    
 I@@ ts f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble design allow@@ s for de@@ ep squ@@ at@@ s, cra@@ w@@ ls and high@@ -@@ ag@@ ility mov@@ em@@ ents.    
 It sen@@ ses what I want to do, where I want to go@@ , and then au@@ g@@ ments my st@@ ren@@ g@@ th and end@@ ur@@ anc@@ e.    
 E@@ y@@ th@@ or B@@ end@@ er@@ : We are ready with our indu@@ str@@ y part@@ ner to intro@@ duce this de@@ vic@@ e, this new ex@@ os@@ k@@ el@@ et@@ on this year.    
 So this is for real@@ .    
 Now let's turn our head@@ s towards the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ ers, something that I'm particularly pas@@ sion@@ ate ab@@ out.    
 There are 6@@ 8 million people es@@ tim@@ ated to be in whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir@@ s world@@ w@@ id@@ e.    
 This is about one percent of the to@@ tal popula@@ tion.    
 And that's actually a con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive es@@ tim@@ ate.    
 We are talking here ab@@ out, of@@ ten@@ times, very young individu@@ als with sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ri@@ es, that in the pri@@ me of their life -- 20@@ s, 3@@ 0@@ s, 4@@ 0@@ s -- hit a w@@ all and the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir@@ 's the only op@@ tion.    
 But it is also the ag@@ ing popula@@ tion that is multi@@ pl@@ ying in numb@@ ers.    
 And the only op@@ tion, pretty much -- when it's st@@ ro@@ ke or other comp@@ li@@ cations -- is the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir@@ .    
 And that is actually for the last 500 years, since its very success@@ ful intro@@ duc@@ tion, I must sa@@ y.    
 So we thought we would start writing a brand new cha@@ p@@ ter of mo@@ b@@ ility.    
 L@@ et me now intro@@ duce you to e@@ L@@ E@@ G@@ S that is wor@@ n by A@@ man@@ d@@ a B@@ o@@ x@@ te@@ l that 1@@ 9 years ago was sp@@ in@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ re@@ d, and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 1@@ 9 years until now.    
   A@@ man@@ d@@ a B@@ o@@ x@@ tel@@ : Thank you.    
   E@@ B@@ : A@@ man@@ d@@ a is we@@ aring our e@@ L@@ E@@ G@@ S se@@ t.    
 It has sen@@ sor@@ s.    
 It's completely n@@ on-@@ inv@@ as@@ i@@ ve, sen@@ sor@@ s in the cru@@ t@@ ch@@ es that s@@ end sig@@ n@@ als back to our on@@ bo@@ ard computer that is sitting here at her back.    
 There are bat@@ ter@@ y pac@@ ks here as well that power mo@@ tors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps, as well as her k@@ ne@@ e jo@@ in@@ ts, that move her forward in this kind of s@@ mo@@ o@@ th and very natural ga@@ it.    
 A@@ B@@ : I was 2@@ 4 years old and at the top of my game when a f@@ rea@@ k sum@@ mer@@ sa@@ ult while down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i@@ ing par@@ aly@@ zed me.    
 In a sp@@ li@@ t secon@@ d, I lo@@ st all sen@@ sa@@ tion and mov@@ ement bel@@ ow my p@@ el@@ vi@@ s.    
 Not long af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds, a doctor st@@ ro@@ de into my hosp@@ ital room@@ , and he said, "A@@ man@@ da@@ , you'll never walk again@@ ."    
 And that was 1@@ 9 ye@@ as ago.    
 He rob@@ bed every oun@@ ce of hope from my be@@ ing.    
 A@@ da@@ p@@ tive technology has since en@@ ab@@ led me to learn how to down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i again, to ro@@ ck clim@@ b and even hand@@ cy@@ c@@ le.    
 But nothing has been invent@@ ed that en@@ ab@@ les me to wal@@ k, until now.    
   Thank you.    
   E@@ B@@ : As you can see, we have the technology, we have the pl@@ at@@ forms to s@@ it down and have disc@@ us@@ sions with you.    
 It's in our han@@ ds, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future gener@@ ations -- not only for the sol@@ di@@ ers, or for A@@ man@@ d@@ a here and all the whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ ers, but for every@@ one.    
 A@@ B@@ : Th@@ an@@ ks.    
 I just came back from a community It's a place where women run the sh@@ ow, have sex to say hel@@ lo@@ , and play rul@@ es the day -- where fu@@ n is seri@@ ous busin@@ ess.    
 And no@@ , this isn't B@@ ur@@ ning M@@ an or S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co@@ .    
   L@@ a@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ m@@ en, meet your cou@@ sin@@ s.    
 This is the world of w@@ il@@ d bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the j@@ un@@ g@@ les of Con@@ go.    
 B@@ on@@ o@@ bo@@ s are, together with ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es, your living clo@@ s@@ est rela@@ tive.    
 That means we all share a comm@@ on anc@@ es@@ tor@@ , an evolu@@ tionary grand@@ mother@@ , who li@@ ved around six million years ago.    
 Now, ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es are well@@ -@@ known for their ag@@ gres@@ sion.    
   But un@@ fortun@@ ately, we have made too much of an emp@@ ha@@ sis of this as@@ pect in our nar@@ ra@@ tiv@@ es of human evolu@@ tion.    
 But bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the co@@ in.    
 Wh@@ i@@ le ch@@ imp@@ an@@ z@@ e@@ es are dom@@ in@@ ated by bi@@ g, sc@@ ary gu@@ ys, bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ power@@ ed fe@@ mal@@ es.    
 These guys have really worked something out, since this lead@@ s to a high@@ ly t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant society where f@@ at@@ al violence has not been ob@@ ser@@ ved ye@@ t.    
 But un@@ fortun@@ ately, bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least underst@@ ood of the great ap@@ es.    
 They live in the dep@@ th@@ s of the Con@@ go@@ l@@ ese j@@ un@@ g@@ le, and it has been very difficult to study them.    
 The Con@@ go is a par@@ a@@ do@@ x -- a land of extraordinary bio@@ di@@ versity and beau@@ ty, but also the heart of dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- that has ra@@ ged for deca@@ des and cla@@ im@@ ed nearly as many lives as the Fir@@ st World War@@ .    
 Not surpri@@ sing@@ ly, this des@@ truc@@ tion also end@@ ang@@ ers bon@@ ob@@ o survi@@ v@@ al.    
 B@@ us@@ h@@ me@@ at tra@@ des and fore@@ st lo@@ ss means we couldn't f@@ ill a small sta@@ di@@ um with all the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s that are left in the world -- and we're not even sure of that to be hon@@ es@@ t.    
 Y@@ e@@ t, in this land of violence and cha@@ o@@ s, you can hear h@@ idd@@ en la@@ ugh@@ ter s@@ wa@@ ying the tre@@ es.    
 Who are these cou@@ sin@@ s?    
 We know them as the "@@ make lo@@ ve, not war@@ " ap@@ es to man@@ age conf@@ li@@ ct and solve social issu@@ es.    
 Now, I'm not sa@@ ying this is the solu@@ tion to all of human@@ it@@ y's problems -- since there's more to bon@@ ob@@ o life than the K@@ am@@ a Su@@ tra@@ .    
 B@@ on@@ o@@ bo@@ s, like human@@ s, love to play through@@ out their entire lives.    
 P@@ la@@ y is not just child@@ 's gam@@ es.    
 For us and them, play is foun@@ da@@ tional for bon@@ ding relationshi@@ ps and f@@ o@@ ster@@ ing t@@ ol@@ er@@ anc@@ e.    
 It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rul@@ es of the game.    
 P@@ la@@ y increas@@ es creativ@@ ity and re@@ si@@ li@@ ence, and it's all about the generation of di@@ versity -- di@@ versity of interac@@ tions, di@@ versity of behavi@@ or@@ s, di@@ versity of connec@@ tions.    
 And when you watch bon@@ ob@@ o pla@@ y, you're seeing the very evolu@@ tionary roo@@ ts of human la@@ ugh@@ ter, d@@ ance and r@@ itu@@ al.    
 P@@ la@@ y is the g@@ l@@ ue that b@@ in@@ ds us together.    
 Now, I don't know how you pla@@ y, but I want to show you a couple of unique cli@@ ps Fir@@ st, it's a b@@ all game bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ st@@ y@@ le -- and I do not mean foo@@ t@@ b@@ all.    
 So here, we have a young fe@@ male and a male eng@@ ag@@ ed in a cha@@ se game.    
 H@@ a@@ ve a look what she's do@@ ing.    
 It might be the evolu@@ tionary or@@ ig@@ in of the ph@@ r@@ as@@ e, "@@ she's got him by the b@@ all@@ s."    
   O@@ n@@ ly I think that he's rather lo@@ ving it here, right?    
 Yea@@ h.    
   So sex play is comm@@ on in both bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and human@@ s.    
 And this video is really interesting because it show@@ s -- this vide@@ o@@ 's really interesting because it show@@ s the inv@@ enti@@ ven@@ ess of br@@ ing@@ ing un@@ usu@@ al el@@ em@@ ents into play -- such as tes@@ tic@@ les -- and also how play both re@@ qui@@ res trust and f@@ o@@ st@@ ers trust -- while at the same time being trem@@ end@@ ous fun@@ .    
 But pla@@ y's a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter.    
   P@@ la@@ y's a sha@@ p@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter, and it can take many for@@ ms, some of which are more qui@@ e@@ t, imagin@@ a@@ tive, curi@@ ous -- maybe where won@@ der is discover@@ ed an@@ ew@@ . And I want you to see, this is F@@ u@@ k@@ u@@ , a young fe@@ mal@@ e, and she is qui@@ et@@ ly playing with water.    
 I think, like her, we sometimes play al@@ one, and we explor@@ e the boun@@ dar@@ ies of our inner and our ou@@ ter worl@@ ds.    
 And it's that play@@ ful curi@@ os@@ ity that dri@@ ves us to explo@@ re, dri@@ ves us to interac@@ t, and then the u@@ nex@@ pec@@ ted connec@@ tions we form are the real ho@@ t@@ bed for creativ@@ ity.    
 So these are just small ta@@ st@@ ers into the in@@ si@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ o give us to our past and pres@@ ent.    
 But they also hold a secre@@ t for our fu@@ ture, a future where we need to adap@@ t to an increas@@ ingly challeng@@ ing world through great@@ er creativ@@ ity and great@@ er co@@ oper@@ ation.    
 The secre@@ t is that play is the key In other words, play is our adap@@ tive w@@ il@@ d@@ car@@ d.    
 In order to adap@@ t success@@ fully to a changing world, we need to pla@@ y.    
 But will we make the most of our play@@ ful@@ n@@ ess@@ ?    
 P@@ la@@ y is not fri@@ vol@@ ous.    
 P@@ la@@ y's ess@@ enti@@ al.    
 For bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and human@@ s ali@@ ke, life is not just red in too@@ th and c@@ law@@ .    
 In times when it seems least appro@@ pri@@ ate to pla@@ y, it might be the times when it is most ur@@ g@@ ent.    
 And so, my fel@@ low pri@@ mat@@ es, let us em@@ br@@ ace this gi@@ ft from evolution and play together, as we re@@ dis@@ co@@ ver creativ@@ ity, fel@@ low@@ ship and won@@ d@@ er.    
 Thank you.    
 B@@ ack in New Yor@@ k, I am the head of development for a n@@ on-@@ prof@@ it called R@@ ob@@ in H@@ oo@@ d.    
 When I'm not fi@@ gh@@ ting po@@ ver@@ ty, I'm fi@@ gh@@ ting fi@@ res as the as@@ sist@@ ant cap@@ tain of a volunte@@ er fire compan@@ y.    
 Now in our tow@@ n, where the volunte@@ ers supp@@ le@@ ment a high@@ ly sk@@ ill@@ ed care@@ er sta@@ ff@@ , you have to get to the fire scen@@ e pretty ear@@ ly to get in on any ac@@ tion.    
 I remember my first fi@@ re.    
 I was the second volunte@@ er on the scen@@ e, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.    
 But still it was a real foo@@ tr@@ ace against the other volunte@@ ers to get to the cap@@ tain in char@@ ge to find out what our assig@@ n@@ ments would be.    
 When I found the cap@@ tain@@ , he was having a very eng@@ ag@@ ing conversation with the home@@ ow@@ n@@ er, who was su@@ rely having one of the worst days of her life.    
 Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the p@@ our@@ ing ra@@ in, under an u@@ mb@@ rel@@ la@@ , in her pa@@ j@@ ama@@ s, b@@ are@@ foo@@ t, The other volunte@@ er who had arri@@ ved just before me -- let's call him Le@@ x L@@ u@@ ther -- got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and save the home@@ ow@@ ner@@ 's do@@ g@@ .    
 The do@@ g@@ ! I was st@@ un@@ ned with jealous@@ y.    
 Here was some law@@ y@@ er or money manag@@ er wh@@ o, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a bur@@ ning building to save a living creatu@@ re, just because he be@@ at me by five secon@@ ds.    
 Well, I was nex@@ t.    
 The cap@@ tain wa@@ ved me over@@ .    
 He said, "@@ Be@@ z@@ o@@ s, I need you to go into the hous@@ e.    
 I need you to go up@@ sta@@ ir@@ s, past the fi@@ re, and I need you to get this woman a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es@@ ."    
   I s@@ we@@ ar@@ .    
 So, not exactly what I was hop@@ ing for@@ , but off I went -- up the sta@@ ir@@ s, down the h@@ all, past the '@@ real@@ ' fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this poin@@ t, into the ma@@ ster be@@ dro@@ om to get a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es.    
 Now I know what you're thinking, but I'm no her@@ o.    
   I car@@ ried my pa@@ y@@ lo@@ ad back down@@ sta@@ ir@@ s where I met my ne@@ mes@@ is and the pre@@ ci@@ ous do@@ g by the front do@@ or.    
 We took our tre@@ as@@ u@@ res outside to the home@@ ow@@ n@@ er, wher@@ e, not surpri@@ sing@@ ly, his recei@@ ved much more att@@ ention than did min@@ e.    
 A few weeks later, the de@@ partment recei@@ ved a let@@ ter from the home@@ ow@@ ner th@@ an@@ king us for the val@@ i@@ ant eff@@ ort disp@@ la@@ yed in sa@@ ving her hom@@ e.    
 The act of kin@@ d@@ ness she no@@ ted abo@@ ve all other@@ s: someone had even gotten her a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es.    
   In both my vo@@ cation at R@@ ob@@ in H@@ ood and my a@@ vo@@ cation as a volunte@@ er fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ter, I am wit@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gener@@ os@@ ity and kin@@ d@@ ness on a mon@@ u@@ mental scal@@ e, but I'm also wit@@ ness to ac@@ ts of gr@@ ace and courage And you know what I've lear@@ ne@@ d?    
 They all mat@@ ter.    
 So as I look around this room at people who ei@@ ther have achiev@@ ed, or are on their way to achiev@@ ing, re@@ mar@@ k@@ able level@@ s of succ@@ ess, I would offer this re@@ min@@ der@@ : don't wa@@ it.    
 D@@ on@@ 't wa@@ it until you make your first million to make a difference in some@@ bod@@ y's life.    
 If you have something to gi@@ ve, give it now.    
 S@@ er@@ ve food at a sou@@ p k@@ it@@ ch@@ en. C@@ le@@ an up a neighbor@@ hood par@@ k.    
 B@@ e a ment@@ or.    
 Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save some@@ bod@@ y's life, but every day offer@@ s us an opportunity to affec@@ t one.    
 So get in the game. S@@ a@@ ve the sho@@ es.    
 Thank you.    
   B@@ run@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ ani@@ : M@@ ar@@ k, M@@ ar@@ k, come back.    
   M@@ ar@@ k Be@@ z@@ os@@ : Thank you.    
 This may sound strang@@ e, but I'm a big f@@ an of the concre@@ te bloc@@ k.    
 The first concre@@ te bloc@@ ks were man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ red in 1@@ 8@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea@@ : mo@@ d@@ ul@@ es made of c@@ ement of a fi@@ x@@ ed meas@@ u@@ re@@ ment that fit together.    
 V@@ ery quick@@ ly concre@@ te bloc@@ ks became the mo@@ st@@ -@@ used construc@@ tion un@@ it in the world.    
 They en@@ ab@@ led us to to build things that were larg@@ er than us, build@@ ings, bri@@ dg@@ es, one bri@@ ck at a time.    
 E@@ s@@ s@@ entially concre@@ te bloc@@ ks had become the building b@@ lo@@ ck of our time.    
 Al@@ most a hundred years later in 19@@ 4@@ 7@@ , L@@ E@@ G@@ O came up with this.    
 It was called the A@@ ut@@ om@@ a@@ tic B@@ in@@ ding B@@ ri@@ c@@ k.    
 And in a few short years, L@@ E@@ G@@ O bri@@ c@@ ks took place in every h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ d.    
 It's es@@ tim@@ ated that over 4@@ 00 billion bri@@ c@@ ks have been produc@@ ed -- or 7@@ 5 bri@@ c@@ ks for every person on the planet.    
 You don't have to be an engine@@ er to make beautiful hous@@ es, beautiful bri@@ dg@@ es, beautiful build@@ ings.    
 L@@ E@@ G@@ O made it acc@@ es@@ sib@@ le.    
 L@@ E@@ G@@ O has ess@@ entially taken the concre@@ te bloc@@ k, the building b@@ lo@@ ck of the world, and made it into the building b@@ lo@@ ck of our imagin@@ ation.    
 M@@ e@@ an@@ while the ex@@ act same year, at B@@ ell L@@ ab@@ s the next re@@ volu@@ tion was about to be an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ed, the next building bloc@@ k.    
 The tran@@ sist@@ or was a small pl@@ as@@ tic un@@ it that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ c@@ ks p@@ il@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was interac@@ tive.    
 Li@@ ke the concre@@ te bloc@@ k, the tran@@ sist@@ or allow@@ s you to build much larg@@ er, more complex cir@@ cu@@ it@@ s, one bri@@ ck at a time.    
 But there's a main differ@@ enc@@ e: The tran@@ sist@@ or was only for exper@@ ts. I person@@ ally don't acc@@ ept this, that the building b@@ lo@@ ck of our time is res@@ er@@ ved for exper@@ ts, so I decided to change that.    
 E@@ ight years ago when I was at the M@@ edi@@ a L@@ ab@@ , I started explor@@ ing this idea of how to put the power of engine@@ ers in the hands of arti@@ sts and desig@@ n@@ ers.    
 A few years ago I started develop@@ ing litt@@ le@@ B@@ it@@ s.    
 L@@ et me show you how they work.    
 L@@ it@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its are elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic mo@@ d@@ ul@@ es with each one speci@@ fic fun@@ c@@ tion.    
 They're pre@@ -@@ engine@@ ered to be li@@ ght, soun@@ d, mo@@ tors and sen@@ sor@@ s.    
 And the best part about it is they s@@ na@@ p together with magne@@ ts.    
 So you can't put them the wrong way.    
 The bri@@ c@@ ks are color@@ -@@ co@@ de@@ d.    
 Gre@@ en is out@@ pu@@ t, bl@@ ue is pow@@ er, p@@ ink is in@@ put and or@@ ange is wi@@ re.    
 So all you need to do is s@@ na@@ p a bl@@ ue to a gre@@ en and very quick@@ ly you can start making larg@@ er cir@@ cu@@ it@@ s.    
 You put a bl@@ ue to a gre@@ en, you can make li@@ ght.    
 You can put a kno@@ b in between and now you've made a little di@@ m@@ mer@@ .    
 S@@ wit@@ ch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le, which is here, and now you've made a little bl@@ in@@ k@@ er.    
 A@@ d@@ d this bu@@ z@@ z@@ er for some ex@@ tr@@ a p@@ unch and you've created a no@@ ise mach@@ ine.    
 I'm going to stop that.    
 So beyond simple pla@@ y, litt@@ le@@ B@@ its are actually pretty power@@ ful.    
 Instea@@ d of having to progr@@ am, to wi@@ re, to sol@@ d@@ er, litt@@ le@@ B@@ its allow you to program using very simple intui@@ tive g@@ es@@ ture@@ s.    
 So to make this bl@@ ink faster or s@@ low@@ er, you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or s@@ low@@ er.    
 The idea behind litt@@ le@@ B@@ its is that it's a growing li@@ br@@ ary.    
 We want to make every single interac@@ tion in the world into a read@@ y@@ -@@ to-@@ use bri@@ c@@ k.    
 Li@@ ght@@ s, soun@@ ds, sol@@ ar pan@@ el@@ s, mo@@ tors -- everything should be acc@@ es@@ sib@@ le.    
 We've been giving litt@@ le@@ B@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them.    
 And it's been an incredi@@ ble experienc@@ e.    
 The n@@ ic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics around them from every@@ day that they don't learn at school@@ s.    
 For example, how a ni@@ ght@@ light work@@ s, or why an el@@ ev@@ at@@ or door sta@@ ys op@@ en, or how an i@@ P@@ od respon@@ ds to tou@@ ch.    
 We've also been taking litt@@ le@@ B@@ its to design school@@ s.    
 with no experience with elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with litt@@ le@@ B@@ its as a materi@@ al.    
 Here you see, with felt and pa@@ per water bo@@ tt@@ l@@ es, we have G@@ e@@ or@@ di@@ e making ...    
     A few weeks ago we took litt@@ le@@ B@@ its to R@@ I@@ S@@ D and gave them to some desig@@ n@@ ers with no experience in engine@@ ering what@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ bo@@ ar@@ d, w@@ ood and pa@@ per -- and told them "@@ Ma@@ ke some@@ thing@@ ."    
 Here's an example of a project they ma@@ de, a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ ac@@ tiv@@ ated con@@ fe@@ tt@@ i can@@ on b@@ all.    
   But wa@@ it, this is actually my favorite projec@@ t.    
 It's a lo@@ b@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ou@@ gh that's afraid of the dar@@ k.    
   To these n@@ on-@@ engine@@ ers, litt@@ le@@ B@@ its became another materi@@ al, elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics became just another materi@@ al.    
 And we want to make this materi@@ al acc@@ es@@ sible to every@@ one.    
 So litt@@ le@@ B@@ its is op@@ en@@ -@@ sour@@ ce.    
 You can go on the we@@ b@@ sit@@ e, down@@ lo@@ ad all the design fil@@ es, make them your@@ self.    
 We want to en@@ courage a world of cre@@ ator@@ s, of invent@@ or@@ s, of con@@ tribu@@ tor@@ s, because this world that we live in, this interac@@ tive world, is our@@ s.    
 So go a@@ head and start invent@@ ing.    
 Thank you.    
 To@@ day I'm going to talk about u@@ nex@@ pec@@ ted discover@@ ies.    
 Now I work in the sol@@ ar technology indu@@ str@@ y.    
 And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to for@@ ce ourselves into the environment by pa@@ ying att@@ ention to ...    
 ... pa@@ ying att@@ ention to c@@ row@@ d-@@ sour@@ c@@ ing.    
 It's just a quic@@ k video H@@ u@@ h. H@@ an@@ g on a mom@@ ent.    
 It might take a moment to lo@@ a@@ d.    
   We@@ 'll just -- we can just sk@@ i@@ p -- I'll just sk@@ i@@ p through the video instead ...    
   No@@ .    
       This is not ...    
   Oka@@ y.    
   S@@ ol@@ ar technology is ...    
 O@@ h, that's all my ti@@ me@@ ?    
 Oka@@ y. Thank you very much.    
 So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the ro@@ c@@ k@@ st@@ ar te@@ ch and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that re@@ pres@@ ents pretty much everything they're supposed to h@@ at@@ e@@ ; we have them work in govern@@ ment.    
 The program is called Co@@ de for Ameri@@ ca, and it's a little bit like a Pe@@ ace C@@ or@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks.    
 We sel@@ ec@@ t a few fel@@ low@@ s every year and we have them work with city govern@@ ment@@ s.    
 Instea@@ d of sen@@ ding them off into the Th@@ ird Wor@@ l@@ d, we s@@ end them into the w@@ il@@ ds of C@@ ity H@@ all.    
 And there they make great app@@ s, they work with city sta@@ ffer@@ s.    
 But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today.    
 So meet Al@@ .    
 A@@ l is a fire hy@@ d@@ r@@ ant in the city of B@@ o@@ st@@ on.    
 Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a dat@@ e, but what he's really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ now@@ ed in, when he's cover@@ ed in four fe@@ et of s@@ now.    
 Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner@@ ?    
 We had a team of fel@@ low@@ s in B@@ o@@ st@@ on last year through the Co@@ de for Americ@@ a progr@@ am.    
 They were there in F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ar@@ y, and it s@@ now@@ ed a lot in F@@ e@@ br@@ u@@ ary last year.    
 And they no@@ tic@@ ed that the city never gets to di@@ gg@@ ing out these fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts.    
 But one fel@@ low in particul@@ ar, a guy nam@@ ed E@@ ri@@ k M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el@@ s@@ -@@ O@@ b@@ er, no@@ tic@@ ed something el@@ se, and that's that citi@@ zens are sho@@ vel@@ ing out s@@ ide@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these things.    
 So he did what any good develop@@ er would do, he wrote an app@@ .    
 It's a cu@@ te little ap@@ p where you can ad@@ op@@ t a fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ t.    
 If you do, you get to name it, and he called the first one Al@@ .    
 And if you don@@ '@@ t, someone can ste@@ al it from you.    
 So it's got cu@@ te little game dy@@ nam@@ ics on it.    
 This is a mo@@ d@@ est little app@@ .    
 of the 2@@ 1 app@@ s that the fel@@ low@@ s wrote last year.    
 But it's doing something that no other government technology do@@ es.    
 It's sp@@ reading vir@@ ally.    
 There's a guy in the I@@ .@@ T@@ . de@@ partment of the C@@ ity of H@@ on@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this ap@@ p and realized that he could use it, not for s@@ now, but to get citi@@ zens to ad@@ op@@ t t@@ sun@@ am@@ i si@@ ren@@ s.    
 It's very important that these t@@ sun@@ am@@ i si@@ ren@@ s work, but people ste@@ al the bat@@ ter@@ ies out of them.    
 So he's getting citi@@ zens to chec@@ k on them.    
 And then Se@@ at@@ tle decided to use it to get citi@@ zens to cle@@ ar out c@@ log@@ ged stor@@ m dra@@ in@@ s.    
 And C@@ hi@@ ca@@ go just ro@@ l@@ led it out to get people to sig@@ n up to sho@@ vel s@@ ide@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ now@@ s.    
 So we now know of nine cities that are plan@@ ning to use this.    
 And this has sp@@ read just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less@@ ly, organ@@ ic@@ ally, n@@ atur@@ ally.    
 If you know anything about government technology, you know that this isn't how it nor@@ m@@ ally go@@ es.    
 P@@ ro@@ cur@@ ing so@@ f@@ tw@@ are usually takes a couple of years.    
 We had a team that worked on a project in B@@ o@@ st@@ on last year that took three people about two and a half month@@ s.    
 It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public school@@ s for their kid@@ s.    
 We were told af@@ ter@@ ward that if that had gone through nor@@ mal chan@@ n@@ el@@ s, it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollar@@ s.    
 And that's no@@ thing.    
 There is one project in the Californi@@ a cour@@ t system right now that so far cost ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ ers two billion dollar@@ s, and it doesn't work.    
 And there are projec@@ ts like this So an ap@@ p that takes a couple of days to write and then sp@@ read@@ s vir@@ ally, that's sort of a sho@@ t across the b@@ ow to the in@@ stitu@@ tion of govern@@ ment.    
 It sugg@@ es@@ ts how government could work better -- not more like a pri@@ v@@ ate compan@@ y, as many people think it sh@@ oul@@ d.    
 And not even like a te@@ ch compan@@ y, but more like the Inter@@ net it@@ self.    
 And that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ l@@ ess, it means op@@ en, it means gener@@ a@@ tive.    
 And that's import@@ ant.    
 But what's more important about this ap@@ p is that it re@@ pres@@ ents how a new generation is t@@ ack@@ ling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an os@@ si@@ fied in@@ stitu@@ tion, but as a problem of collec@@ tive ac@@ tion.    
 be@@ cause, it turns out, we're very good at collec@@ tive ac@@ tion with digital technolog@@ y.    
 Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effec@@ tiv@@ el@@ y.    
 It's not just Co@@ de for Americ@@ a fel@@ low@@ s, there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing ci@@ vi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communi@@ ties.    
 They haven't given up on govern@@ ment.    
 They are fru@@ str@@ ated as hel@@ l with it, but they're not comp@@ la@@ ining about it, they're fi@@ x@@ ing it.    
 And these fol@@ ks know something that we've lo@@ st si@@ ght of.    
 And that's that when you stri@@ p away all your feel@@ ings about poli@@ tics and the line at the D@@ M@@ V and all those other things that we're really ma@@ d ab@@ out, government is, at its co@@ re, in the words of T@@ i@@ m O@@ '@@ Re@@ ill@@ y, "What we do together that we can't do al@@ one@@ ."    
 Now a lot of people have given up on govern@@ ment.    
 And if you're one of those people, I would ask that you re@@ consid@@ er, because things are chang@@ ing.    
 P@@ o@@ li@@ tics is not chang@@ ing@@ ; government is chang@@ ing.    
 And because government ultim@@ ately der@@ i@@ ves its power from us -- remember "@@ We the people@@ ?" -- how we think about it is going to effec@@ t how that change happen@@ s.    
 Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this progr@@ am.    
 And like a lot of people, I thought government was basically about getting people elec@@ ted to offic@@ e.    
 Well after two years, I've come to the con@@ cl@@ usi@@ on that, especially local govern@@ ment, is about op@@ os@@ sum@@ s.    
 This is the call cent@@ er for the services and information lin@@ e.    
 if you call 3@@ 1@@ 1 in your city.    
 If you should ever have the chance to st@@ af@@ f your c@@ it@@ y's call cent@@ er, as our fel@@ low S@@ co@@ t@@ t S@@ il@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact, they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very w@@ ide ran@@ ge of issu@@ es, including having an op@@ os@@ su@@ m st@@ uc@@ k in your hous@@ e.    
 So S@@ co@@ t@@ t gets this call@@ .    
 He types "O@@ pos@@ sum@@ " into this offic@@ ial knowledge bas@@ e.    
 He doesn't really come up with any@@ thing. He starts with ani@@ mal contro@@ l@@ .    
 And finally, he says, "@@ L@@ oo@@ k, can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really l@@ oud and see if the thing lea@@ v@@ es@@ ?"    
 So that wor@@ ke@@ d. So boo@@ y@@ a for S@@ co@@ t@@ t.    
 But that wasn't the end of the op@@ os@@ sum@@ s.    
 B@@ o@@ st@@ on doesn't just have a call cent@@ er.    
 It has an app@@ , a We@@ b and mobile app@@ , called C@@ i@@ ti@@ zens Con@@ nec@@ t.    
 Now we didn't write this app@@ .    
 This is the work of the very smar@@ t people So one day -- this is an actu@@ al repor@@ t -- this came in@@ : "O@@ pos@@ su@@ m in my tr@@ ash@@ can@@ . C@@ an@@ 't tell if it's dea@@ d.    
 How do I get this re@@ mov@@ ed@@ ?"    
 But what happens with C@@ i@@ ti@@ zens Con@@ ne@@ ct is differ@@ ent.    
 So S@@ co@@ t@@ t was spea@@ king person@@ -@@ to-@@ pers@@ on.    
 But on C@@ i@@ ti@@ zens Con@@ ne@@ ct everything is pub@@ lic@@ , so everybody can see this.    
 And in this case, a neigh@@ b@@ or saw it.    
 And the next repor@@ t we got said, "I walked over to this lo@@ cation, found the tr@@ ash@@ can behind the hous@@ e.    
 O@@ pos@@ sum@@ ? Ch@@ ec@@ k. Li@@ v@@ ing? Y@@ ep@@ .    
 T@@ ur@@ ned tr@@ ash@@ can on its sid@@ e. W@@ al@@ ked hom@@ e.    
 Goo@@ d@@ ni@@ ght s@@ we@@ et op@@ os@@ sum@@ ."    
   P@@ re@@ t@@ ty simp@@ le.    
 So this is great@@ . This is the digital me@@ e@@ ting the physic@@ al.    
 And it's also a great example of government getting in on the c@@ row@@ d-@@ sour@@ c@@ ing game.    
 But it's also a great example of government as a pl@@ at@@ for@@ m. And I don't mean necess@@ arily a techno@@ logical defin@@ i@@ tion of pl@@ at@@ form here.    
 I'm just talking about a pl@@ at@@ form for people to help themselves and to help other@@ s.    
 So one citi@@ z@@ en helped another citi@@ z@@ en, but government play@@ ed a key ro@@ le here.    
 It connec@@ ted those two people.    
 And it could have connec@@ ted them with government services if they@@ 'd been ne@@ e@@ ded, but a neigh@@ b@@ or is a far better and chea@@ per alter@@ na@@ tive to government servic@@ es.    
 When one neigh@@ b@@ or hel@@ ps an@@ other@@ , we st@@ ren@@ g@@ then our communi@@ ties.    
 We call ani@@ mal contro@@ l@@ , it just co@@ sts a lot of mone@@ y.    
 Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as poli@@ tic@@ s.    
 And most people get that, but they think that one is the in@@ put to the other.    
 That our in@@ put to the system of government is vo@@ t@@ ing.    
 Now how many times have we elec@@ ted a political lead@@ er -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political lead@@ er elec@@ ted -- and then we s@@ it back and we ex@@ pect government to ref@@ le@@ ct our valu@@ es and meet our need@@ s, and then not that much chang@@ es?    
 That's because government is like a v@@ ast oce@@ an and poli@@ tics is the si@@ x@@ -@@ in@@ ch lay@@ er on top@@ .    
 And what's under that is what we call bu@@ rea@@ uc@@ rac@@ y.    
 And we say that word with such contemp@@ t.    
 But it's that contemp@@ t that keep@@ s this thing that we own and we pa@@ y for as something that's working against us, this other thing, and then we're dise@@ m@@ pow@@ ering our@@ selves.    
 People seem to think poli@@ tics is sex@@ y.    
 If we want this in@@ stitu@@ tion to work for us, we're going to have to make bu@@ rea@@ uc@@ rac@@ y sex@@ y.    
 Because that's where the real work of government happen@@ s.    
 We have to eng@@ age with the mach@@ in@@ ery of govern@@ ment.    
 So that's O@@ c@@ cu@@ p@@ y@@ the@@ S@@ E@@ C mov@@ ement has don@@ e.    
 H@@ a@@ ve you seen these gu@@ y@@ s?    
 It's a group of con@@ cer@@ ned citi@@ zens that have writ@@ ten a very deta@@ il@@ ed that's a respon@@ se to the S@@ E@@ C@@ 's re@@ qu@@ est for com@@ ment on the F@@ in@@ anci@@ al Re@@ form B@@ ill@@ .    
 That's not being poli@@ tically ac@@ tive, that's being bu@@ rea@@ uc@@ ra@@ tically ac@@ tive.    
 Now for those of us who@@ 've given up on govern@@ ment, it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children@@ .    
 You have to see the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous challeng@@ es that they're going to fac@@ e.    
 Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fi@@ x@@ ing the one in@@ stitu@@ tion that can act on be@@ half of all of us@@ ?    
 We can't do without govern@@ ment, to be more effec@@ tive.    
 The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundament@@ ally ref@@ r@@ ame the fun@@ c@@ tion of government in a way that can actually scale by st@@ ren@@ g@@ th@@ ening ci@@ vi@@ l societ@@ y.    
 And there's a generation out there that's grow@@ n up on the Inter@@ ne@@ t, and they know that it's not that hard to do things together, you just have to architec@@ t the systems the right way.    
 Now the average age of our fel@@ low@@ s is 2@@ 8@@ , so I am, beg@@ ru@@ dg@@ ing@@ ly, almost a generation ol@@ der than most of them.    
 This is a generation that's grow@@ n up taking their voic@@ es pretty much for gran@@ ted.    
 They're not fi@@ gh@@ ting that bat@@ tle that we're all fi@@ gh@@ ting about who gets to spea@@ k@@ ; they all get to spea@@ k.    
 They can ex@@ pres@@ s their opini@@ on on any chan@@ ne@@ l at any time, and they do.    
 So when they're fac@@ ed with the problem of govern@@ ment, they don't care as much about using their voic@@ es.    
 They're using their han@@ ds.    
 They're using their hands to write appli@@ cations that make government work better.    
 And those appli@@ cations let us use our hands to make our communities better.    
 That could be sho@@ vel@@ ing out a hy@@ d@@ ran@@ t, pul@@ ling a we@@ ed, tur@@ ning over a gar@@ b@@ age can with an op@@ os@@ su@@ m in it.    
 And certain@@ ly, we could have been sho@@ vel@@ ing out those fire hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts all al@@ ong, and many people do.    
 But these app@@ s are like little digital re@@ mind@@ ers that we're not just con@@ su@@ mer@@ s, and we're not just con@@ sum@@ ers of govern@@ ment, putting in our ta@@ x@@ es and getting back servic@@ es.    
 We're more than that, we're citi@@ zen@@ s.    
 And we're not going to fi@@ x government until we fi@@ x citi@@ zen@@ shi@@ p.    
 So the question I have for all of you her@@ e: When it comes to the bi@@ g, important things that we need to do together, all of us together, are we just going to be a c@@ row@@ d of voic@@ es, or are we also going to be a c@@ row@@ d of hand@@ s?    
 Thank you.    
 Well this is a really extraordinary hon@@ or for me.    
 I spend most of my time in j@@ a@@ il@@ s, in pri@@ son@@ s, on death row@@ .    
 I spend most of my time in very low@@ -@@ in@@ come communities in the projec@@ ts and places where there's a great deal of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ n@@ ess.    
 And being here at TED and seeing the s@@ tim@@ ula@@ tion, hear@@ ing it, has been very, very en@@ er@@ gi@@ zing to me.    
 And one of the things that's emerg@@ ed in my short time here is that TED has an identi@@ ty. And you can actually say things here that have imp@@ ac@@ ts around the world.    
 And sometimes when it comes through TED@@ , it has mean@@ ing and power that it doesn't have when it does@@ n'@@ t.    
 And I men@@ tion that because I think identity is really import@@ ant.    
 And we've had some f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic present@@ a@@ tions.    
 And I think what we've learned is that, if you're a te@@ ac@@ her your words can be mean@@ ing@@ ful, but if you're a comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate teach@@ er, they can be especially mean@@ ing@@ ful.    
 If you're a doctor you can do some good things, but if you're a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things.    
 And so I want to talk about the power of identi@@ ty.    
 And I didn't learn about this actually prac@@ tic@@ ing la@@ w and doing the work that I do.    
 I actually learned about this from my grand@@ mother@@ .    
 I grew up in a house that was the tra@@ di@@ tional Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American home that was dom@@ in@@ ated by a mat@@ ri@@ arch@@ , and that mat@@ ri@@ arch was my grand@@ mother@@ .    
 She was tou@@ gh, she was str@@ ong, she was power@@ ful.    
 She was the end of every argu@@ ment in our famil@@ y.    
 She was the beginning of a lot of argu@@ ments in our famil@@ y.    
 She was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sla@@ v@@ ed.    
 H@@ er parents were born in sla@@ very in V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a in the 1@@ 8@@ 4@@ 0@@ '@@ s.    
 She was born in the 1@@ 8@@ 80@@ 's and the experience of sla@@ very very much sha@@ ped the way she saw the world.    
 And my grand@@ mother was tou@@ gh, but she was also lo@@ v@@ ing.    
 When I would see her as a little bo@@ y, she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hu@@ g@@ s.    
 And she'd squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze me so ti@@ ght I could b@@ are@@ ly brea@@ the and then she'd let me go.    
 And an hour or two later, if I saw her, she'd come over to me and she'd say, "@@ Br@@ y@@ an, do you still feel me hu@@ gg@@ ing you@@ ?"    
 And if I said, "@@ No@@ ," she'd as@@ sa@@ ult me again, and if I said, "@@ Y@@ es@@ ," she'd leave me al@@ one.    
 And she just had this qu@@ ality that you always wanted to be near her@@ .    
 And the only challenge was that she had 10 children@@ .    
 My mo@@ m was the youn@@ g@@ est of her 10 kid@@ s.    
 And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her, it would be difficult to get her time and att@@ en@@ tion.    
 My cou@@ sin@@ s would be run@@ ning around every@@ wher@@ e.    
 And I rememb@@ er, when I was about eight or nine years old, wa@@ king up one morning, going into the living room@@ , and all of my cou@@ sin@@ s were run@@ ning aroun@@ d.    
 And my grand@@ mother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me.    
 And at first I thought we were playing a game.    
 And I would look at her and I'd s@@ mi@@ le, but she was very seri@@ ous.    
 And after about 15 or 20 minut@@ es of this, she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said, "@@ C@@ ome on, Br@@ y@@ an. You and I are going to have a tal@@ k@@ ."    
 And I remember this just like it happened y@@ es@@ ter@@ day.    
 I never will for@@ get it.    
 She took me out back and she said, "@@ Br@@ y@@ an, I'm going to tell you some@@ thing, but you don't tell anybody what I tell you@@ ."    
 I said, "O@@ ka@@ y, M@@ ama@@ ."    
 She said, "@@ Now you make sure you don't do that@@ ." I said, "@@ Su@@ re@@ ."    
 Then she s@@ at me down and she looked at me and she said, "I want you to know I've been watching you@@ ."    
 And she said, "I think you're speci@@ al@@ ."    
 She said, "I think you can do anything you want to do@@ ."    
 I will never for@@ get it.    
 And then she said, "I just need you to prom@@ ise me three things, Br@@ y@@ an@@ ."    
 I said, "O@@ ka@@ y, M@@ ama@@ ."    
 She said, "The first thing I want you to prom@@ ise me is that you'll always love your mom@@ ."    
 She said, "@@ That's my b@@ ab@@ y girl@@ , and you have to prom@@ ise me now you'll always take care of her@@ ."    
 Well I a@@ do@@ red my mom@@ , so I said, "@@ Y@@ es, M@@ ama@@ . I'll do that@@ ."    
 Then she said, "The second thing I want you to prom@@ ise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing@@ ."    
 And I thought about it and I said, "@@ Y@@ es, M@@ ama@@ . I'll do that@@ ."    
 Then finally she said, "The third thing I want you to prom@@ ise me is that you'll never d@@ rin@@ k al@@ co@@ hol@@ ."    
   Well I was nine years old, so I said, "@@ Y@@ es, M@@ ama@@ . I'll do that@@ ."    
 I grew up in the country in the ru@@ ral S@@ ou@@ th, and I have a bro@@ ther a year ol@@ der than me and a si@@ ster a year youn@@ g@@ er.    
 When I was about 1@@ 4 or 1@@ 5@@ , one day my bro@@ ther came home and he had this si@@ x@@ -@@ p@@ ack of be@@ er -- I don't know where he got it -- and he gr@@ ab@@ bed me and my si@@ ster and we went out in the w@@ oo@@ ds.    
 And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we craz@@ ily di@@ d.    
 And he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my si@@ ster and she had som@@ e, and they offer@@ ed it to me.    
 I said, "@@ No, no@@ , no@@ . That's oka@@ y. You all go a@@ hea@@ d. I'm not going to have any be@@ er@@ ."    
 My bro@@ ther said, "@@ C@@ ome on. We're doing this to@@ day@@ ; you always do what we do.    
 I had som@@ e, your si@@ ster had som@@ e. H@@ a@@ ve some be@@ er@@ ."    
 I said, "@@ No, I don't feel right about that. Y@@ '@@ all go a@@ hea@@ d. Y@@ '@@ all go a@@ head@@ ."    
 And then my bro@@ ther started star@@ ing at me.    
 He said, "@@ What's wrong with you@@ ? H@@ a@@ ve some be@@ er@@ ."    
 Then he looked at me real hard and he said, "O@@ h, I hope you're not still hun@@ g up on that conversation M@@ am@@ a had with you@@ ."    
   I said, "Well, what are you talking ab@@ out@@ ?"    
 He said, "O@@ h, M@@ am@@ a tel@@ ls all the grand@@ kids that they're speci@@ al@@ ."    
   I was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated.    
   And I'm going to adm@@ it something to you.    
 I'm going to tell you something I probably sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n'@@ t.    
 I know this might be bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ st bro@@ ad@@ ly.    
 But I'm 5@@ 2 years old, and I'm going to adm@@ it to you that I've never had a dro@@ p of al@@ co@@ hol@@ .    
   I don't say that because I think that's virtu@@ ous@@ ; I say that because there is power in identi@@ ty.    
 When we create the right kind of identi@@ ty, we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe makes sen@@ se.    
 We can get them to do things that they don't think they can do.    
 When I thought about my grand@@ mother@@ , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were speci@@ al.    
 My grand@@ father was in pri@@ son during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion.    
 My male un@@ cl@@ es died of al@@ co@@ hol@@ -@@ rel@@ ated diseas@@ es.    
 And these were the things she thought we needed to comm@@ it to.    
 about our cri@@ min@@ al jus@@ tice system.    
 This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.    
 In 19@@ 7@@ 2@@ , there were 3@@ 00@@ ,000 people in j@@ a@@ ils and pri@@ son@@ s.    
 To@@ day, there are 2@@ .@@ 3 milli@@ on.    
 The United States now has the high@@ est r@@ ate of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the world.    
 We have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ o@@ le.    
 And ma@@ ss in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation, in my judg@@ ment, has fundament@@ ally changed our world.    
 In po@@ or communi@@ ties, in communities of color there is this des@@ pa@@ ir@@ , that is being sha@@ ped by these out@@ com@@ es.    
 One out of three black men between the ages of 1@@ 8 and 30 is in j@@ a@@ il, in pri@@ s@@ on, on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le.    
 In ur@@ b@@ an communities across this country -- L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es, P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ i@@ a, B@@ al@@ ti@@ mo@@ re, W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on -- 50 to 6@@ 0 percent of all young men of color are in j@@ a@@ il or pri@@ son or on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le.    
 Our system isn't just being sha@@ ped in these ways that seem to be di@@ stor@@ ting around rac@@ e, they're also di@@ stor@@ ted by po@@ ver@@ ty.    
 We have a system of jus@@ tice in this country that tre@@ at@@ s you much better if you're rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you're po@@ or and inno@@ c@@ ent.    
 We@@ al@@ th, not cul@@ p@@ ab@@ il@@ ity, sha@@ p@@ es out@@ com@@ es.    
 And ye@@ t, we seem to be very comfor@@ tab@@ le.    
 The poli@@ tics of fe@@ ar and ang@@ er have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problem@@ s.    
 We've been dis@@ connec@@ ted.    
 It's interesting to me.    
 We're looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work.    
 My state of Al@@ ab@@ ama@@ , like a number of st@@ ates, actually per@@ man@@ ently di@@ sen@@ f@@ ran@@ ch@@ is@@ es you if you have a cri@@ min@@ al con@@ vic@@ tion.    
 Ri@@ ght now in Al@@ ab@@ am@@ a 3@@ 4 percent of the black male popula@@ tion has per@@ man@@ ently lo@@ st the right to vo@@ t@@ e.    
 We're actually projec@@ ting in another 10 years the level of di@@ sen@@ f@@ ran@@ chi@@ se@@ ment will be as high as it's been since pri@@ or to the pas@@ sa@@ ge of the V@@ o@@ ting Ri@@ ghts A@@ c@@ t.    
 And there is this st@@ un@@ ning sil@@ ence.    
 I re@@ present children@@ .    
 A lot of my cli@@ ents are very youn@@ g@@ .    
 The United States is the only country in the world where we s@@ ent@@ ence 1@@ 3@@ -year-old children to di@@ e in pri@@ s@@ on.    
 We have life imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ment without par@@ o@@ le for kids in this countr@@ y.    
 And we're actually doing some li@@ ti@@ ga@@ tion.    
 The only country in the world.    
 I re@@ present people on death row@@ .    
 It's interes@@ ting, this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty.    
 In many wa@@ ys, we've been taught to think do people deser@@ ve to di@@ e for the cri@@ m@@ es they@@ 've comm@@ it@@ te@@ d?    
 And that's a very sen@@ sible ques@@ tion.    
 But there's another way of thinking about where we are in our identi@@ ty.    
 The other way of thinking about it is not, do people deser@@ ve to di@@ e for the cri@@ m@@ es they comm@@ it, but do we deser@@ ve to kill@@ ?    
 I mean, it's fascin@@ at@@ ing.    
 D@@ e@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty in Americ@@ a is defin@@ ed by er@@ r@@ or.    
 For every nine people who have been ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted, we've actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ c@@ ent person who's been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and rele@@ as@@ ed from death row@@ .    
 A kind of ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing er@@ ro@@ r r@@ ate -- one out of nine people inno@@ c@@ ent.    
 I mean, it's fascin@@ at@@ ing.    
 In a@@ vi@@ ation, we would never let people f@@ ly on air@@ plan@@ es if for every nine plan@@ es that took off one would cr@@ ash@@ .    
 But some@@ how we can in@@ sul@@ ate ourselves from this problem.    
 It's not our problem.    
 It's not our bur@@ d@@ en.    
 It's not our stru@@ gg@@ le.    
 I talk a lot about these issu@@ es.    
 I talk about rac@@ e and this question of whether we deser@@ ve to kill@@ .    
 And it's interes@@ ting, when I teach my students about Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American hi@@ story, I tell them about sla@@ ver@@ y.    
 I tell them about ter@@ ror@@ ism, the er@@ a that began at the end of re@@ construc@@ tion that went on to World W@@ ar I@@ I@@ .    
 We don't really know very much about it.    
 But for Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americ@@ ans in this countr@@ y, that was an er@@ a defin@@ ed by ter@@ r@@ or.    
 In many communi@@ ties, people had to wor@@ ry about being ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ed.    
 They had to wor@@ ry about being b@@ om@@ be@@ d.    
 It was the thre@@ at of ter@@ ro@@ r that sha@@ ped their lives.    
 And these ol@@ der people come up to me now and they say, "@@ M@@ r. Ste@@ ven@@ s@@ on, you give tal@@ ks, you make spe@@ e@@ ch@@ es, you tell people to stop sa@@ ying we're de@@ al@@ ing with ter@@ ror@@ ism for the first time in our na@@ tion@@ 's history after 9@@ /@@ 1@@ 1@@ ."    
 They tell me to say, "@@ No, tell them that we grew up with that@@ ."    
 And that er@@ a of ter@@ ror@@ ism, of course, was follow@@ ed by se@@ gre@@ g@@ ation and deca@@ des of rac@@ ial sub@@ ordin@@ ation and a@@ par@@ the@@ id@@ .    
 And ye@@ t, we have in this country this dy@@ nam@@ ic where we really don't like to talk about our problem@@ s.    
 We don't like to talk about our hi@@ story.    
 And because of that, we really haven't underst@@ ood what it's me@@ ant to do the things we've done hi@@ stor@@ ic@@ ally.    
 We're con@@ stan@@ tly run@@ ning into each other.    
 We're con@@ stan@@ tly creating ten@@ sions and conf@@ lic@@ ts.    
 We have a hard time talking about rac@@ e, and I believe it's because we are un@@ willing to comm@@ it ourselves to a process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation.    
 In South Afri@@ ca, people underst@@ ood that we couldn't over@@ come a@@ par@@ the@@ id without a comm@@ it@@ ment to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation.    
 In R@@ wan@@ da@@ , even after the gen@@ oc@@ id@@ e, there was this comm@@ it@@ ment, but in this country we haven't done that.    
 I was giving some lec@@ tures in Ger@@ many about the death pen@@ al@@ ty.    
 It was fascin@@ ating because one of the sch@@ ol@@ ars st@@ ood up after the present@@ ation and said, "@@ Well you know it's deep@@ ly tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ing to hear what you're talking ab@@ out@@ ."    
 He said, "@@ We don't have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in Ger@@ man@@ y.    
 And of course, we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in Ger@@ man@@ y."    
 And the room got very qui@@ e@@ t, and this woman said, "@@ There's no way, with our hi@@ story, we could ever eng@@ age in the sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic kill@@ ing of human be@@ ings.    
 It would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to, in an in@@ ten@@ tional and deli@@ ber@@ ate way, set about ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ting people@@ ."    
 And I thought about that.    
 What would it feel like where the n@@ ation state of Ger@@ many was ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ting people, especially if they were dis@@ pro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately J@@ e@@ wi@@ sh@@ ?    
 I couldn't be@@ ar it.    
 It would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able.    
 And ye@@ t, in this countr@@ y, in the st@@ ates of the O@@ ld S@@ ou@@ th, we ex@@ ec@@ u@@ te people -- where you're 1@@ 1 times more likely to get the death pen@@ al@@ ty if the vic@@ ti@@ m is white than if the vic@@ ti@@ m is bl@@ ac@@ k, 2@@ 2 times more likely to get it if the def@@ end@@ ant is black and the vic@@ ti@@ m is white -- in the very st@@ ates where there are bu@@ ried in the grou@@ nd the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ed. And ye@@ t, there is this dis@@ connec@@ t.    
 Well I believe that our identity is at ris@@ k.    
 That when we actually don't care about these difficult things, the posi@@ tive and wonder@@ ful things are n@@ one@@ the@@ less imp@@ lic@@ ated.    
 We love inno@@ va@@ tion.    
 We love technolog@@ y. We love creativ@@ ity.    
 We love enter@@ tain@@ ment.    
 But ultim@@ ately, those real@@ i@@ ties are sha@@ dow@@ ed by suffer@@ ing, ab@@ us@@ e, de@@ gra@@ da@@ tion, mar@@ g@@ in@@ al@@ iz@@ ation.    
 And for me, it becomes necess@@ ary to inte@@ gr@@ ate the tw@@ o.    
 Because ultim@@ ately we are talking about a need to be more hop@@ e@@ ful, more comm@@ it@@ ted, more de@@ dic@@ ated to the basic challeng@@ es of living in a complex world.    
 And for me that means sp@@ ending time thinking and talking about the po@@ or, the disa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge@@ d, those who will never get to TED@@ .    
 But thinking about them in a way that is inte@@ gr@@ ated in our own lives.    
 You know ultim@@ ately, we all have to believe things we haven't se@@ en.    
 We do. As ra@@ tional as we are, as comm@@ it@@ ted to in@@ tel@@ le@@ ct as we are.    
 In@@ no@@ va@@ tion, creativ@@ ity, not from the ideas in our mind al@@ one.    
 They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fuel@@ ed by some con@@ vic@@ tion in our hear@@ t.    
 And it's that min@@ d-@@ heart connec@@ tion that I believe comp@@ el@@ s us to not just be att@@ enti@@ ve to all the b@@ right and da@@ z@@ z@@ ly things, but also the dar@@ k and difficult things.    
 V@@ ac@@ la@@ v H@@ a@@ vel@@ , the great C@@ z@@ ec@@ h lead@@ er, talked about this.    
 He said, "@@ When we were in E@@ a@@ ster@@ n E@@ uro@@ pe and de@@ al@@ ing with op@@ pres@@ sion, we wanted all kinds of things, but mo@@ st@@ ly what we needed was hop@@ e, an ori@@ ent@@ ation of the spir@@ it, a will@@ ing@@ ness to sometimes be in hop@@ el@@ ess places and be a wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ."    
 Well that ori@@ ent@@ ation of the spi@@ rit is very much at the cor@@ e of what I believe even TED communities have to be eng@@ ag@@ ed in.    
 There is no dis@@ con@@ ne@@ ct around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pa@@ y att@@ ention to suffer@@ ing, to po@@ ver@@ ty, to ex@@ cl@@ usi@@ on, to un@@ fa@@ ir@@ ness, to in@@ jus@@ tic@@ e.    
 Now I will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challeng@@ ing identity than ones that don't pa@@ y att@@ ention to this.    
 It will get to you.    
 I had the great pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ e, when I was a young law@@ y@@ er, of me@@ e@@ ting R@@ os@@ a Par@@ ks.    
 And M@@ s. Par@@ ks used to come back to M@@ on@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then, and she would get together with two of her de@@ are@@ st friends, Jo@@ h@@ n@@ ni@@ e C@@ ar@@ r who was the organ@@ iz@@ er of the M@@ on@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery bu@@ s bo@@ y@@ co@@ t@@ t -- amazing Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American woman -- and V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a D@@ ur@@ r@@ , a white wom@@ an, wh@@ ose h@@ us@@ b@@ and, C@@ li@@ ff@@ ord D@@ ur@@ r@@ , represent@@ ed D@@ r. K@@ ing.    
 And these women would get together and just tal@@ k.    
 And every now and then M@@ s. C@@ ar@@ r would call me, and she'd say, "@@ Br@@ y@@ an, M@@ s. Par@@ ks is coming to tow@@ n. We're going to get together and tal@@ k.    
 Do you want to come over and list@@ en@@ ?"    
 And I'd say, "@@ Y@@ es, Ma@@ '@@ am, I do@@ ."    
 And she'd say, "@@ Well what are you going to do when you get her@@ e@@ ?"    
 I said, "I'm going to list@@ en@@ ."    
 And I'd go over there and I w@@ oul@@ d, I would just list@@ en.    
 It would be so en@@ er@@ gi@@ zing and so em@@ power@@ ing.    
 And one time I was over there list@@ ening to these women tal@@ k, and after a couple of hours M@@ s. Par@@ ks turned to me and she said, "@@ Now Br@@ y@@ an, tell me what the E@@ qu@@ al J@@ us@@ tice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative is.    
 T@@ ell me what you're trying to do@@ ."    
 And I began giving her my ra@@ p.    
 I said, "@@ Well we're trying to challenge in@@ jus@@ tic@@ e.    
 We're trying to help people who have been wr@@ ong@@ ly con@@ vic@@ ted.    
 We're trying to conf@@ ront bi@@ as and disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation in the ad@@ min@@ ist@@ ra@@ tion of cri@@ min@@ al jus@@ tic@@ e. We're trying to end life without par@@ o@@ le s@@ ent@@ ences for children@@ .    
 We're trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty.    
 We're trying to re@@ duce the pri@@ son popula@@ tion.    
 We're trying to end ma@@ ss in@@ car@@ cer@@ a@@ tion@@ ."    
 I gave her my whole ra@@ p, and when I fin@@ ish@@ ed she looked at me and she said, "@@ M@@ m@@ m mm@@ m mm@@ m@@ ."    
 She said, "@@ That's going to make you ti@@ re@@ d, ti@@ re@@ d, ti@@ re@@ d@@ ."    
   And that's when M@@ s. C@@ ar@@ r le@@ an@@ ed for@@ war@@ d, she put her fing@@ er in my fac@@ e, she said, "@@ That's why you've got to be bra@@ ve, bra@@ ve, bra@@ ve@@ ."    
 And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more coura@@ ge@@ ous.    
 We need to find ways to em@@ br@@ ace these challeng@@ es, these problem@@ s, the suffer@@ ing.    
 Because ultim@@ ately, our human@@ ity dep@@ ends on every@@ one's human@@ ity.    
 I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.    
 It's just taught me very simple things.    
 I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever don@@ e.    
 I believe that for every person on the planet.    
 I think if somebody tel@@ ls a li@@ e, they're not just a li@@ ar@@ .    
 I think if somebody takes something that doesn't bel@@ ong to them, they're not just a thi@@ e@@ f@@ .    
 I think even if you kill some@@ one, you're not just a kill@@ er.    
 And because of that there's this basic human dig@@ n@@ ity that must be res@@ pec@@ ted by law@@ .    
 that in many par@@ ts of this countr@@ y, and certainly in many par@@ ts of this glo@@ be, that the op@@ pos@@ ite of po@@ ver@@ ty is not we@@ al@@ th.    
 I don't believe that.    
 I actually think, in too many plac@@ es, the op@@ pos@@ ite of po@@ ver@@ ty is jus@@ tic@@ e.    
 And finally, I believe that, des@@ p@@ ite the fact that it is so drama@@ tic and so beautiful and so in@@ spir@@ ing and so s@@ tim@@ ul@@ at@@ ing, we will ultim@@ ately not be judg@@ ed by our technology, we won@@ 't be judg@@ ed by our desig@@ n, we won@@ 't be judg@@ ed by our in@@ tel@@ le@@ ct and reas@@ on.    
 U@@ l@@ tim@@ ately, you judge the charac@@ ter of a societ@@ y, not by how they tre@@ at their rich and the powerful and the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge@@ d, but by how they tre@@ at the po@@ or, the con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated.    
 Because it's in that nex@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly pro@@ found things about who we are.    
 I sometimes get out of bal@@ anc@@ e. I'll end with this story.    
 I sometimes pus@@ h too har@@ d.    
 I do get ti@@ re@@ d, as we all do.    
 Some@@ times those ideas get a@@ head of our thinking in ways that are import@@ ant.    
 And I've been represent@@ ing these kids who have been s@@ ent@@ enc@@ ed to do these very har@@ sh s@@ ent@@ enc@@ es.    
 and he's been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand tri@@ al as an adul@@ t.    
 I start thinking, well, how did that happen@@ ?    
 How can a judge turn you into something that you're no@@ t?    
 And the judge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an adul@@ t, but I see this kid@@ .    
 And I was up too l@@ ate one ni@@ ght and I starting thinking, well go@@ sh@@ , if the judge can turn you into something that you're not, the judge must have magic pow@@ er.    
 Yea@@ h, Br@@ y@@ an, the judge has some magic pow@@ er.    
 You should ask for some of that.    
 And because I was up too lat@@ e, wasn't thinking real stra@@ i@@ ght, I started working on a mo@@ tion.    
 And I had a cli@@ ent who was 1@@ 4 years old, a youn@@ g, po@@ or black kid@@ .    
 And I started working on this mo@@ tion, and the head of the mo@@ tion was@@ : "@@ Mo@@ tion to try my po@@ or, 1@@ 4@@ -year-old black male cli@@ ent like a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge@@ d, white 7@@ 5@@ -year-old cor@@ por@@ ate ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tiv@@ e."    
   And I put in my mo@@ tion that there was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tor@@ ial mis@@ con@@ duc@@ t and poli@@ ce mis@@ con@@ duc@@ t and ju@@ di@@ ci@@ al mis@@ con@@ duc@@ t.    
 There was a crazy line in there about how there's no con@@ duc@@ t in this coun@@ ty, it's all mis@@ con@@ duc@@ t.    
 And the next morning, I w@@ o@@ ke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy mo@@ tion, or did I actually write it?    
 And to my hor@@ r@@ or, not only had I writ@@ ten it, but I had sent it to cour@@ t.    
   A couple months went b@@ y, and I had just for@@ gotten all about it.    
 And I finally dec@@ ide@@ d, o@@ h go@@ sh@@ , I've got to go to the cour@@ t and do this crazy ca@@ se.    
 And I got into my car and I was feeling really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ me@@ d.    
 And I got in my car and I went to this cour@@ thous@@ e.    
 And I was thinking, this is going to be so diffic@@ ul@@ t, so pain@@ ful.    
 And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the cour@@ thous@@ e.    
 And as I was walking up the st@@ ep@@ s of this cour@@ thous@@ e, there was an ol@@ der black man who was the j@@ an@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thous@@ e.    
 When this man saw me, he came over to me and he said, "@@ Who are you@@ ?"    
 I said, "I'm a law@@ y@@ er@@ ." He said, "@@ You're a law@@ y@@ er@@ ?" I said, "@@ Y@@ es, si@@ r@@ ."    
 And this man came over to me and he hu@@ gg@@ ed me.    
 And he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed in my ear@@ .    
 He said, "I'm so p@@ rou@@ d of you@@ ."    
 And I have to tell you, it was en@@ er@@ gi@@ z@@ ing. It connec@@ ted deep@@ ly with something in me about identi@@ ty, about the cap@@ ac@@ ity of every person to con@@ tribu@@ te to a commun@@ ity, to a perspec@@ tive that is hop@@ e@@ ful.    
 Well I went into the cour@@ tro@@ om@@ .    
 And as soon as I walked insid@@ e, the judge saw me coming in.    
 He said, "@@ M@@ r. Ste@@ ven@@ s@@ on, did you write this crazy mo@@ tion@@ ?"    
 I said, "@@ Y@@ es, si@@ r. I di@@ d@@ ." And we started argu@@ ing.    
 And people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ d.    
 I had writ@@ ten these crazy things.    
 And poli@@ ce offic@@ ers were coming in and as@@ sist@@ ant pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tors and cl@@ er@@ k work@@ ers.    
 And before I knew it, the cour@@ tro@@ om was f@@ ill@@ ed with people an@@ gr@@ y that we were talking about rac@@ e, that we were talking about po@@ ver@@ ty, that we were talking about ine@@ qu@@ al@@ ity.    
 And out of the cor@@ ner of my ey@@ e, I could see this j@@ an@@ it@@ or pac@@ ing back and for@@ th.    
 And he k@@ ept looking through the win@@ dow@@ , and he could hear all of this hol@@ l@@ er.    
 He k@@ ept pac@@ ing back and for@@ th.    
 And finally, this ol@@ der black man with this very wor@@ ried look on his face came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and s@@ at down behind me, almost at coun@@ se@@ l tab@@ le.    
 A@@ b@@ out 10 minut@@ es later the judge said we would take a brea@@ k.    
 And during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty sh@@ eri@@ ff who was off@@ ended that the j@@ an@@ it@@ or had come into cour@@ t.    
 And this de@@ pu@@ ty ju@@ mp@@ ed up and he r@@ an over to this ol@@ der black man@@ .    
 He said, "@@ J@@ im@@ m@@ y, what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om@@ ?"    
 And this ol@@ der black man st@@ ood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man, keep your ey@@ es on the pri@@ z@@ e, hold on@@ ."    
 I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the mor@@ al ar@@ c of the univer@@ se is long@@ , but it b@@ ends tow@@ ard jus@@ tic@@ e. That we cannot be full ev@@ ol@@ ved human be@@ ings until we care about human rights and basic dig@@ n@@ ity.    
 That all of our survi@@ v@@ al is ti@@ ed to the survi@@ v@@ al of every@@ one.    
 That our vi@@ sions of technology and design and enter@@ tain@@ ment and creativ@@ ity have to be married with vi@@ sions of human@@ ity, comp@@ as@@ sion and jus@@ tic@@ e.    
 And more than any@@ thing, for those of you who share that, I've simply come to tell you to keep your ey@@ es on the pri@@ z@@ e, hold on.    
 Thank you very much.    
   Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : So you heard and saw an obvi@@ ous des@@ i@@ re by this audi@@ ence, this commun@@ ity, to help you on your way and to do something on this issu@@ e.    
 O@@ ther than writing a chec@@ k, what could we do@@ ?    
 B@@ S: Well there are oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties all around us.    
 If you live in the state of Californi@@ a, for example, there's a ref@@ er@@ end@@ um coming up this sp@@ r@@ ing where actually there's going to be an eff@@ ort to re@@ direc@@ t some of the money we spend on the poli@@ tics of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment.    
 For example, here in Californi@@ a we're going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollar@@ s.    
 And ye@@ t, 4@@ 6 percent of all hom@@ ic@@ ide ca@@ ses don't result in ar@@ re@@ st.    
 5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ pe ca@@ ses don't resul@@ t.    
 So there's an opportunity to change that.    
 And this ref@@ er@@ end@@ um would pro@@ p@@ ose having those dollars go to la@@ w en@@ forc@@ ement and sa@@ fe@@ ty.    
 And I think that opportunity exist@@ s all around us.    
 CA: There's been this huge de@@ cl@@ ine in cri@@ me in Americ@@ a over the last three deca@@ d@@ es.    
 And part of the nar@@ ra@@ tive of that is sometimes that it's about increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation r@@ at@@ es.    
 What would you say to someone who believ@@ ed that?    
 B@@ S: Well actually the viol@@ ent cri@@ me r@@ ate has re@@ ma@@ ined rela@@ tively st@@ able.    
 The great increase in ma@@ ss in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn't really in viol@@ ent cri@@ me categ@@ ori@@ es.    
 It was this mis@@ gu@@ ided wa@@ r on d@@ ru@@ g@@ s.    
 That's where the drama@@ tic increas@@ es have come in our pri@@ son popula@@ tion.    
 And we got car@@ ried away with the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment.    
 And so we have three stri@@ kes law@@ s that put people in pri@@ son fore@@ ver for ste@@ al@@ ing a b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le, for low@@ -@@ level proper@@ ty cri@@ m@@ es, rather than making them give those resour@@ ces back to the people who they victim@@ iz@@ ed.    
 I believe we need to do more to help people who are victim@@ ized by cri@@ me, not do l@@ ess.    
 And I think our cur@@ ren@@ t p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment ph@@ i@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y does nothing for no one.    
 And I think that's the ori@@ ent@@ ation that we have to change.

 C@@ ri@@ si@@ s. D@@ ea@@ th. Di@@ sa@@ st@@ er.    
 O@@ h, my Go@@ d.    
 Pe@@ ter Di@@ am@@ an@@ dis@@ : So those are just a few of the cli@@ ps I collec@@ ted over the last six months -- could have eas@@ ily been the last six days or the last six years.    
 The point is that the news media pre@@ fer@@ entially fe@@ eds us nega@@ tive stories because that's what our min@@ ds pa@@ y att@@ ention to.    
 And there's a very good reason for that.    
 Every second of every day, our sen@@ ses bring in way too much data than we can possib@@ ly process in our bra@@ in@@ s.    
 And because nothing is more important to us than survi@@ v@@ al, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sli@@ ver of the temp@@ or@@ al lo@@ be called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a.    
 Now the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ al@@ a is our ear@@ ly war@@ ning de@@ te@@ c@@ tor@@ , our dang@@ er de@@ te@@ c@@ tor@@ .    
 It sorts and s@@ cour@@ s through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might har@@ m us.    
 So given a do@@ z@@ en news stor@@ ies, we will pre@@ fer@@ entially look at the nega@@ tive new@@ s.    
 And that old new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er say@@ ing, "@@ If it b@@ le@@ eds it lead@@ s@@ ," is very tru@@ e.    
 So given all of our digital de@@ vic@@ es that are br@@ ing@@ ing all the nega@@ tive news to us seven days a wee@@ k, 2@@ 4 hours a day, it's no won@@ der that we're p@@ es@@ si@@ mis@@ tic.    
 It's no won@@ der that people think that the world is getting wor@@ se.    
 But perhaps that's not the ca@@ se.    
 P@@ er@@ ha@@ ps instea@@ d, it's the di@@ stor@@ tions brought to us of what's really going on.    
 P@@ er@@ ha@@ ps the trem@@ end@@ ous progres@@ s we've made over the last centur@@ y are, in fact, acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three deca@@ des to create a world of ab@@ und@@ anc@@ e.    
 Now I'm not sa@@ ying climate cri@@ si@@ s, species ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion, water and energy shor@@ ta@@ ge -- we su@@ rely do.    
 And as human@@ s, we are far better at seeing the problems way in adv@@ anc@@ e, but ultim@@ ately we kno@@ ck them dow@@ n.    
 So let's look at what this last centur@@ y has been to see where we're go@@ ing.    
 O@@ ver the last hundred years, the average human lif@@ es@@ p@@ an has more than d@@ ou@@ b@@ le@@ d, average per cap@@ it@@ a in@@ come ad@@ ju@@ sted for in@@ fla@@ tion around the world has tri@@ ple@@ d.    
 Ch@@ il@@ d@@ hood mor@@ tal@@ ity has come down a fac@@ tor of 10@@ .    
 A@@ d@@ d to that the cost of food, elec@@ tric@@ ity, transp@@ or@@ ta@@ tion, communi@@ cation have dro@@ pped 10 to 1@@ ,00@@ 0@@ -@@ fol@@ d.    
 Ste@@ ve P@@ in@@ k@@ er has show@@ ed us that, in fact, we're living during the most pe@@ ace@@ ful time ever in human hi@@ story.    
 And Ch@@ ar@@ les Ken@@ ny that global liter@@ ac@@ y has gone from 2@@ 5 percent to over 8@@ 0 percent in the last 1@@ 30 years. We truly are living in an extraordinary time.    
 And many people for@@ get this.    
 And we keep se@@ tting our expec@@ ta@@ tions high@@ er and high@@ er.    
 In fact, we re@@ def@@ ine what po@@ ver@@ ty mean@@ s.    
 Th@@ ink of this, in Americ@@ a today, the maj@@ or@@ ity of people under the po@@ ver@@ ty line still have elec@@ tric@@ ity, wat@@ er, to@@ i@@ le@@ ts, re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ ator@@ s, tel@@ e@@ vi@@ sion, mobile ph@@ on@@ es, air condi@@ tion@@ ing and car@@ s.    
 The we@@ al@@ thi@@ est rob@@ b@@ er bar@@ ons of the last centur@@ y, the em@@ per@@ ors on this plane@@ t, could have never dre@@ am@@ ed of such lu@@ x@@ u@@ ri@@ es.    
 Un@@ der@@ p@@ in@@ ning much of this is technology, and of lat@@ e, exp@@ on@@ entially growing technologi@@ es.    
 My good friend R@@ a@@ y K@@ ur@@ z@@ we@@ il show@@ ed that any tool that becomes an information technology ju@@ mp@@ s on this cur@@ ve, on M@@ oo@@ re@@ 's L@@ aw@@ , and experienc@@ es pri@@ ce perfor@@ man@@ ce d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ing every 1@@ 2 to 2@@ 4 month@@ s.    
 That's why the cell@@ phone in your po@@ c@@ ket than a super@@ computer of the '@@ 7@@ 0@@ s.    
 Now look at this cur@@ ve.    
 This is M@@ oo@@ re@@ 's L@@ a@@ w over the last hundred years.    
 I want you to no@@ tice two things from this cur@@ ve.    
 N@@ u@@ mb@@ er one, how s@@ mo@@ o@@ th it is -- through good time and bad time, wa@@ r time and pe@@ ace time, rec@@ es@@ sion, de@@ pres@@ sion and boo@@ m time.    
 This is the result of faster compu@@ ters being used to build faster compu@@ ters.    
 It doesn't s@@ low for any of our gr@@ and challeng@@ es.    
 on a lo@@ g cur@@ ve on the lef@@ t, it's cur@@ ving up@@ war@@ ds.    
 The r@@ ate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting fa@@ st@@ er.    
 And on this cur@@ ve, ri@@ ding on M@@ oo@@ re@@ 's L@@ aw@@ , are a set of extra@@ ordin@@ arily powerful technologi@@ es avail@@ able to all of us.    
 C@@ l@@ oud compu@@ ting, what my friends at A@@ u@@ to@@ des@@ k call in@@ fin@@ ite compu@@ t@@ ing@@ ; sen@@ sor@@ s and net@@ work@@ s@@ ; robo@@ tic@@ s@@ ; 3@@ D prin@@ ting, which is the ability to demo@@ cra@@ ti@@ ze and di@@ stri@@ bu@@ te person@@ al@@ ized produc@@ tion around the plan@@ et@@ ; syn@@ the@@ tic bio@@ log@@ y@@ ; fuel@@ s, vacc@@ ines and foo@@ ds@@ ; digital medic@@ ine@@ ; n@@ an@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ al@@ s@@ ; and A@@ .@@ I@@ .    
 I mean, how many of you saw the win@@ ning of J@@ e@@ op@@ ar@@ dy by I@@ B@@ M@@ 's W@@ at@@ son@@ ?    
 I mean, that was ep@@ ic.    
 In fact, I s@@ cou@@ red the head@@ lin@@ es looking for the best head@@ line in a new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er I cou@@ l@@ d.    
 And I love this: "@@ W@@ at@@ son V@@ an@@ qui@@ sh@@ es H@@ u@@ man O@@ pp@@ on@@ ent@@ s."    
 J@@ e@@ op@@ ar@@ d@@ y's not an easy game.    
 It's about the nu@@ ance of human langu@@ age.    
 And imagine if you would A@@ .@@ I@@ .@@ 's like this on the cl@@ oud avail@@ able to every person with a cell@@ ph@@ one.    
 F@@ our years ago here at TED@@ , R@@ a@@ y K@@ ur@@ z@@ we@@ il and I started a new uni@@ versity called S@@ ing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity.    
 And we teach our students all of these technologi@@ es, and particularly how they can be used to solve human@@ it@@ y's gr@@ and challeng@@ es.    
 And every year we ask them to start a company or a produc@@ t or a ser@@ vice that can affec@@ t posi@@ tively the lives of a billion people within a deca@@ de.    
 Th@@ ink about that, the fact that, liter@@ ally, a group of students can tou@@ ch the lives of a billion people today.    
 30 years ago that would have soun@@ ded lu@@ dic@@ rou@@ s.    
 To@@ day we can point at do@@ zens of companies that have done just that.    
 When I think about creating ab@@ und@@ anc@@ e, it's not about creating a life of lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y for everybody on this plan@@ et@@ ; it's about creating a life of possib@@ ility.    
 It is about taking that which was sc@@ ar@@ ce and making it ab@@ und@@ ant.    
 You see, sc@@ ar@@ city is cont@@ ex@@ tu@@ al, and technology is a resour@@ c@@ e-@@ li@@ ber@@ ating forc@@ e.    
 L@@ et me give you an examp@@ le.    
 So this is a story of Na@@ po@@ le@@ on I@@ I@@ I H@@ e's the du@@ de on the lef@@ t.    
 He inv@@ ited over to d@@ inner All of Na@@ po@@ le@@ on@@ 's tro@@ op@@ s were f@@ ed with sil@@ ver ut@@ en@@ sil@@ s, Na@@ po@@ le@@ on hi@@ m@@ self with go@@ ld ut@@ en@@ sil@@ s.    
 But the K@@ ing of Si@@ am, he was f@@ ed with al@@ u@@ min@@ um ut@@ en@@ sil@@ s.    
 You see, al@@ u@@ min@@ um was the most valu@@ able me@@ tal on the plane@@ t, worth more than go@@ ld and pl@@ at@@ in@@ u@@ m.    
 It's the reason that the ti@@ p of the W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on M@@ on@@ u@@ ment is made of al@@ u@@ min@@ u@@ m.    
 You see, even though al@@ u@@ min@@ um is 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the Earth by mas@@ s, it doesn't come as a pu@@ re me@@ tal@@ .    
 It's all b@@ ound by o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en and si@@ lic@@ at@@ es.    
 But then the technology of elec@@ tro@@ ly@@ sis came along and literally made al@@ u@@ min@@ um so chea@@ p that we use it with th@@ row@@ -@@ away ment@@ al@@ ity.    
 So let's project this an@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ y going for@@ war@@ d.    
 We think about energy sc@@ ar@@ city.    
 L@@ a@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ m@@ en, we are on a plan@@ et that is ba@@ th@@ ed with 5@@ ,000 times more energy than we use in a year.    
 1@@ 6 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy h@@ its the Ear@@ th@@ 's sur@@ face every 8@@ 8 minut@@ es.    
 It's not about being sc@@ ar@@ ce, it's about acc@@ es@@ sib@@ ility.    
 And there's good news here.    
 For the first time, this year the cost of sol@@ ar@@ -@@ gener@@ ated elec@@ tri@@ city is 50 percent that of di@@ es@@ el@@ -@@ gener@@ ated elec@@ tri@@ city in Indi@@ a -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es ver@@ su@@ s 1@@ 7 ru@@ pe@@ es.    
 The cost of sol@@ ar dro@@ pped 50 percent last year.    
 L@@ ast mon@@ th, M@@ I@@ T put out a study showing that by the end of this deca@@ de, in the sun@@ ny par@@ ts of the United St@@ ates, sol@@ ar elec@@ tri@@ city will be six c@@ ents a ki@@ lo@@ wat@@ t hour comp@@ ared to 15 c@@ ents as a national aver@@ age.    
 And if we have ab@@ und@@ ant energ@@ y, we also have ab@@ und@@ ant water.    
 Now we talk about water war@@ s.    
 Do you remember when C@@ ar@@ l S@@ ag@@ an turned the V@@ o@@ y@@ ag@@ er spac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft back towards the Ear@@ th, in 19@@ 9@@ 0 after it just pas@@ sed S@@ atur@@ n@@ ?    
 He took a fam@@ ous photo@@ . What was it cal@@ le@@ d?    
 "@@ A P@@ al@@ e B@@ l@@ ue Do@@ t@@ ."    
 Because we live on a water planet.    
 We live on a plan@@ et 7@@ 0 percent cover@@ ed by water.    
 Y@@ es, 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent is sal@@ tw@@ at@@ er, two percent is ic@@ e, and we fi@@ ght over a half a percent of the water on this plane@@ t, but here too there is hop@@ e.    
 And there is technology coming on@@ lin@@ e, not 10@@ , 20 years from now, right now.    
 There's n@@ an@@ o@@ technology coming on, n@@ an@@ om@@ at@@ eri@@ als.    
 And the conversation I had with D@@ e@@ an K@@ am@@ en this morning, one of the great D@@ I@@ Y inno@@ v@@ ator@@ s, I'd like to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mis@@ sion to do so -- his technology called S@@ l@@ ing@@ sho@@ t that many of you may have heard of, it is the si@@ ze of a small d@@ or@@ m room re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or.    
 out of any sour@@ ce -- sal@@ tw@@ at@@ er, pol@@ lu@@ ted wat@@ er, lat@@ r@@ ine -- at less than two c@@ ents a lit@@ er.    
 The cha@@ ir@@ man of Co@@ ca@@ -@@ C@@ ol@@ a has just ag@@ re@@ ed of hundreds of un@@ its of this in the develop@@ ing world.    
 And if that p@@ ans out, which I have every conf@@ idence it will@@ , Co@@ ca@@ -@@ C@@ ol@@ a will dep@@ lo@@ y this glo@@ b@@ ally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet.    
 This is the kind of inno@@ va@@ tion, em@@ power@@ ed by this technology, that exist@@ s today. And we've seen this in cell@@ ph@@ on@@ es.    
 My goo@@ d@@ ness, we're going to hit 7@@ 0 percent p@@ ene@@ tra@@ tion of cell@@ ph@@ ones in the develop@@ ing world by the end of 20@@ 1@@ 3@@ .    
 Th@@ ink about it, that a M@@ as@@ a@@ i war@@ ri@@ or on a cell@@ phone in the middle of Ken@@ y@@ a than Presid@@ ent Re@@ ag@@ an did 2@@ 5 years ago.    
 And if they're on a smar@@ t@@ phone on Goog@@ le, they@@ 've got acc@@ ess to more knowledge and information than Presid@@ ent C@@ lin@@ t@@ on did 15 years ago.    
 They're living in a world of information and communi@@ cation ab@@ und@@ ance that no one could have ever pre@@ dic@@ ted.    
 the things that you and I spent ten@@ s and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- G@@ P@@ S@@ , H@@ D video and still imag@@ es, li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies of books and mus@@ ic, medi@@ cal di@@ ag@@ no@@ sti@@ c technology -- are now literally de@@ materi@@ al@@ izing and de@@ mone@@ ti@@ zing into your cell@@ ph@@ one.    
 P@@ rob@@ ably the best part of it is what's coming down the pi@@ ke in heal@@ th.    
 L@@ ast mon@@ th, I had the ple@@ as@@ ure of an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ ing with Q@@ u@@ al@@ com@@ m F@@ oun@@ da@@ tion something called the $@@ 10 million Q@@ u@@ al@@ com@@ m T@@ ri@@ c@@ order X P@@ ri@@ z@@ e.    
 We're challeng@@ ing te@@ ams around the world to basically comb@@ ine these technologi@@ es into a mobile de@@ vice that you can speak to, because it's got A@@ .@@ I@@ .@@ , you can cou@@ gh on it, you can do a fing@@ er blood pri@@ c@@ k.    
 And to w@@ in, it needs to be able to di@@ ag@@ no@@ se you better than a team of bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied doc@@ tor@@ s.    
 So liter@@ ally, imagine this de@@ vice in the middle of the develop@@ ing world where there are no doc@@ tor@@ s, 2@@ 5 percent of the dise@@ ase bur@@ d@@ en and 1@@ .@@ 3 percent of the health care work@@ ers.    
 When this de@@ vice sequ@@ ences an R@@ N@@ A or DN@@ A vir@@ us that it doesn't recog@@ n@@ iz@@ e, it call@@ s the C@@ D@@ C and pre@@ v@@ ents the pan@@ de@@ mi@@ c from happen@@ ing in the first plac@@ e.    
 But here, here is the biggest for@@ ce for br@@ ing@@ ing about a world of ab@@ und@@ anc@@ e.    
 I call it the ri@@ sing billi@@ on.    
 So the white lin@@ es here are popula@@ tion.    
 We just pas@@ sed the seven billion mar@@ k on Ear@@ th.    
 And by the way, the biggest prote@@ c@@ tion against a popula@@ tion explo@@ sion is making the world educ@@ ated and health@@ y.    
 In 20@@ 10@@ , we had just short of two billion people on@@ lin@@ e, connec@@ ted.    
 By 20@@ 20@@ , Inter@@ net us@@ ers.    
 Th@@ ree billion new min@@ ds who have never been heard from before are connec@@ ting to the global conversa@@ tion.    
 What will these people wan@@ t?    
 What will they con@@ su@@ me@@ ? What will they des@@ i@@ re@@ ?    
 And rather than having econom@@ ic sh@@ ut@@ dow@@ n, we're about to have the biggest econom@@ ic in@@ jec@@ tion ever@@ .    
 These people re@@ present ten@@ s of tr@@ illi@@ ons of dollars in@@ jec@@ ted into the global econom@@ y.    
 And they will get heal@@ thi@@ er by using the T@@ ri@@ c@@ ord@@ er, and they@@ 'll become better educ@@ ated by using the K@@ ha@@ n A@@ ca@@ de@@ m@@ y, and by literally being able to use 3@@ D prin@@ ting and in@@ fin@@ ite compu@@ ting [@@ be@@ com@@ e@@ ] more produc@@ tive than ever before.    
 So what could three billion ris@@ ing, health@@ y, educ@@ ated, produc@@ tive memb@@ ers of human@@ ity bring to us@@ ?    
 How about a set of voic@@ es that have never been heard from before.    
 What about giving the op@@ pres@@ se@@ d, wher@@ ever they might be, the vo@@ ice to be heard and the vo@@ ice to act for the first time ever@@ ?    
 What will these three billion people br@@ ing?    
 What about con@@ tribu@@ tions we can't even pre@@ dic@@ t?    
 The one thing I've learned at the X P@@ ri@@ ze is that small te@@ ams dri@@ ven by their passion with a cle@@ ar foc@@ us can do extraordinary things, things that large cor@@ por@@ ations and govern@@ ments could only do in the pa@@ st.    
 L@@ et me share and close with a story that really got me exc@@ it@@ ed.    
 There is a program that some of you might have heard of.    
 It's a game called F@@ old@@ it.    
 It came out of the U@@ ni@@ versity of W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on in Se@@ att@@ le.    
 And this is a game where individu@@ als can actually take a sequ@@ ence of am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id@@ s and figure out how the prote@@ in is going to fol@@ d.    
 And how it fol@@ ds dic@@ t@@ ates its struc@@ ture and its fun@@ c@@ tion@@ al@@ ity.    
 And it's very important for research in medic@@ ine.    
 And up until now, it's been a super@@ computer problem.    
 And this game has been play@@ ed by uni@@ versity prof@@ ess@@ ors and so for@@ th.    
 And it's liter@@ ally, hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it.    
 And it show@@ ed that, in fact, today, the human patter@@ n recog@@ ni@@ tion mach@@ in@@ ery is better at fol@@ ding prote@@ ins than the best compu@@ ters.    
 And when these individu@@ als went and looked at who was the best prote@@ in fol@@ der in the world, it wasn't an M@@ I@@ T prof@@ ess@@ or, it wasn't a C@@ al@@ T@@ ec@@ h stud@@ ent, it was a person from Eng@@ lan@@ d, from Man@@ ch@@ es@@ ter, a woman wh@@ o, during the day, was an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive as@@ sist@@ ant at a re@@ ha@@ b cl@@ in@@ ic and, at night, was the world@@ 's best prote@@ in fol@@ d@@ er.    
 L@@ a@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ m@@ en, what gi@@ ves me trem@@ end@@ ous conf@@ idence in the future is the fact that we are now more em@@ power@@ ed as individu@@ als to take on the gr@@ and challeng@@ es of this planet.    
 We have the tools with this exp@@ on@@ ential technolog@@ y.    
 We have the passion of the D@@ I@@ Y inno@@ v@@ at@@ or.    
 We have the cap@@ ital of the techno@@ -@@ ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ st.    
 And we have three billion new min@@ ds coming online to work with us to solve the gr@@ and challeng@@ es, to do that which we must do.    
 We are living into extraordinary deca@@ des a@@ hea@@ d.    
 Thank you.    
 I'm going to speak about a tin@@ y, little idea@@ .    
 And this is about shi@@ f@@ ting bas@@ el@@ ine.    
 And because the idea can be expla@@ ined in one minut@@ e, I will tell you three stories before to f@@ ill in the time.    
 And the first story is about Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in, one of my her@@ o@@ es.    
 And he was here, as you well know, in '@@ 3@@ 5@@ .    
 And you'd think he was cha@@ sing fin@@ ch@@ es, but he was@@ n'@@ t.    
 He was actually collec@@ ting fish@@ .    
 And he descri@@ bed one of them as very "@@ com@@ mon@@ ."    
 This was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per@@ .    
 A big fish@@ ery was run on it until the '@@ 80@@ s.    
 Now the fish is on the I@@ U@@ C@@ N R@@ ed L@@ ist@@ .    
 Now this story, we have heard it lots of times on G@@ al@@ a@@ pa@@ go@@ s and other plac@@ es, so there is nothing particular about it.    
 But the point is, we still come to G@@ al@@ a@@ pa@@ go@@ s.    
 We still think it is pri@@ st@@ ine.    
 The bro@@ ch@@ u@@ res still say it is un@@ tou@@ ch@@ ed.    
 So what happens her@@ e?    
 The second story, also to ill@@ u@@ str@@ ate another concep@@ t, is called shi@@ f@@ ting wa@@ ist@@ lin@@ e.    
   Because I was there in '@@ 7@@ 1, stud@@ ying a la@@ go@@ on in W@@ est Afri@@ ca@@ .    
 I was there because I grew up in E@@ uro@@ pe and I wanted later to work in Afri@@ ca@@ .    
 And I thought I could bl@@ end in.    
 And I got a big sun@@ bur@@ n, and I was con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that I was really not from there.    
 This was my first sun@@ bur@@ n.    
 And the la@@ go@@ on was sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded by p@@ al@@ m tre@@ es, as you can see, and a few man@@ g@@ ro@@ ve.    
 And it had ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a about 20 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters, a species of ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a called bl@@ ack@@ ch@@ in ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a.    
 And the fish@@ er@@ ies for this ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a sustain@@ ed lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in G@@ han@@ a.    
 When I went there 2@@ 7 years later, the fish had sh@@ run@@ k to half of their si@@ z@@ e.    
 They were mat@@ ur@@ ing at five c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters.    
 They had been push@@ ed gene@@ tic@@ ally.    
 There were still fish@@ es.    
 They were still kind of happ@@ y.    
 And the fish also were happy to be there.    
 So nothing has chan@@ ge@@ d, but everything has chan@@ ge@@ d.    
 My third little story is that I was an ac@@ comp@@ li@@ ce in the intro@@ duc@@ tion of tra@@ w@@ ling in S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a.    
 In the '@@ 7@@ 0@@ s -- well, beginning in the '@@ 6@@ 0@@ s -- E@@ uro@@ pe did lots of development projec@@ ts.    
 F@@ ish development me@@ ant impos@@ ing on countries that had already 1@@ 00@@ ,000 fish@@ ers to imp@@ ose on them indu@@ stri@@ al fish@@ ing.    
 And this bo@@ at, quite u@@ g@@ ly, is called the M@@ u@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4@@ .    
 And I went sa@@ il@@ ing on it, and we did sur@@ ve@@ ys through@@ out the sou@@ ther@@ n South Chin@@ a se@@ a and especially the J@@ a@@ v@@ a S@@ ea@@ .    
 And what we ca@@ u@@ ght, we didn't have words for it.    
 What we ca@@ u@@ ght, I know now, is the bo@@ t@@ to@@ m of the se@@ a.    
 And 9@@ 0 percent of our cat@@ ch were sp@@ ong@@ es, other anim@@ als that are fi@@ x@@ ed on the bo@@ t@@ tom@@ .    
 And actually most of the fish@@ , they are a little spo@@ t on the de@@ bri@@ s, the p@@ il@@ es of de@@ bri@@ s, were cor@@ al ree@@ f fish@@ .    
 E@@ s@@ s@@ entially the bo@@ t@@ to@@ m of the se@@ a came onto the dec@@ k and then was th@@ row@@ n dow@@ n.    
 And these pictures are extraordinary because this tran@@ si@@ tion is very ra@@ p@@ id@@ .    
 Wi@@ th@@ in a year, you do a sur@@ v@@ ey and then comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al fish@@ ing begin@@ s.    
 The bo@@ t@@ to@@ m is trans@@ for@@ med from@@ , in this case, a hard bo@@ t@@ to@@ m or so@@ ft cor@@ al into a mu@@ d@@ dy m@@ ess.    
 This is a de@@ ad tur@@ t@@ le.    
 They were not e@@ at@@ en, they were th@@ row@@ n away because they were dea@@ d.    
 And one time we caught a live one.    
 It was not d@@ row@@ ned ye@@ t.    
 And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to e@@ at.    
 This moun@@ tain of de@@ br@@ is is actually collec@@ ted by fish@@ ers into an area that's never been fish@@ ed.    
 But it's not do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ed.    
 We trans@@ form the world, but we don't remember it.    
 We ad@@ just our bas@@ el@@ ine to the new level@@ , and we don't rec@@ all what was there.    
 If you gener@@ al@@ ize this, something like this happen@@ s.    
 You have on the y a@@ x@@ is some good thing@@ : bio@@ di@@ vers@@ ity, numb@@ ers of or@@ ca, the gre@@ en@@ ness of your countr@@ y, the water supp@@ ly.    
 And over time it changes -- because people do things, or n@@ atur@@ ally.    
 Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their consci@@ ous lives as a stand@@ ard and will extra@@ pol@@ ate for@@ war@@ d.    
 And the difference then, they perc@@ ei@@ ve as a lo@@ s@@ s.    
 But they don't perc@@ ei@@ ve what happened before as a lo@@ s@@ s.    
 You can have a succ@@ es@@ sion of chang@@ es.    
 At the end you want to su@@ sta@@ in mis@@ er@@ able lef@@ to@@ ver@@ s.    
 And that, to a large ex@@ t@@ ent, is what we want to do now.    
 We want to su@@ sta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they wer@@ e.    
 Now one should think this problem affec@@ ted people certainly when in pre@@ dat@@ or@@ y socie@@ ties, they killed anim@@ als and they didn't know they had done so after a few gener@@ a@@ tions. Be@@ cause, obvi@@ ous@@ ly, an ani@@ mal that is very ab@@ und@@ ant, before it gets ex@@ tin@@ c@@ t, it becomes ra@@ re.    
 So you don't lo@@ se ab@@ und@@ ant anim@@ als.    
 You always lo@@ se r@@ are anim@@ als.    
 And ther@@ e@@ fore they're not perc@@ ei@@ ved as a big lo@@ s@@ s.    
 O@@ ver time, we con@@ cent@@ r@@ ate on large anim@@ als, and in a se@@ a that means the big fish@@ .    
 They become ra@@ re@@ r because we fish them.    
 O@@ ver time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ el@@ ine.    
 And the question is, why do people acc@@ ept this?    
 Well because they don't know that it was differ@@ ent.    
 And in fact, lots of people, scienti@@ sts, will cont@@ est that it was really differ@@ ent.    
 And they will cont@@ est this because the evidence present@@ ed in an earli@@ er mo@@ de is not in the way they would like the evidence present@@ ed.    
 For example, the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that some pres@@ ent, as C@@ ap@@ tain so@@ -@@ an@@ d-@@ so ob@@ ser@@ ved lots of fish in this area or is usually not u@@ ti@@ li@@ zed by fish@@ ery scienti@@ sts, because it's not "@@ scienti@@ fic@@ ."    
 So you have a situation where people don't know the pa@@ st, even though we live in liter@@ ate socie@@ ties, because they don't trust the sour@@ ces of the pa@@ st.    
 And h@@ ence, the en@@ or@@ m@@ ous ro@@ le that a mar@@ ine prote@@ c@@ ted area can pla@@ y.    
 Because with mar@@ ine prote@@ c@@ ted are@@ as, we actually re@@ create the pa@@ st.    
 We re@@ create the past that people cannot con@@ c@@ ei@@ ve because the bas@@ el@@ ine has shi@@ f@@ ted and is ex@@ trem@@ ely low@@ .    
 That is for people who can see a mar@@ ine prote@@ c@@ ted area and who can bene@@ fit from the in@@ si@@ ght that it provid@@ es, which en@@ ab@@ les them to re@@ set their bas@@ el@@ ine.    
 How about the people who can't do that because they have no acc@@ ess -- the people in the M@@ id@@ w@@ est for examp@@ le@@ ?    
 There I think that the ar@@ ts and film can perhaps f@@ ill the ga@@ p, and si@@ mu@@ la@@ tion.    
 This is a si@@ mu@@ la@@ tion of Ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke B@@ a@@ y.    
 There were gra@@ y wh@@ al@@ es in Ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke B@@ a@@ y a long time ago -- 500 years ago.    
 And you will have no@@ tic@@ ed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ."    
   And if you think about "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," if you think of why people were so tou@@ ched by it -- never mind the P@@ o@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so tou@@ ched by the imag@@ er@@ y?    
 Because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lo@@ st.    
 And so my re@@ comm@@ en@@ da@@ tion, it's the only one I will provid@@ e, is for C@@ am@@ er@@ on to do "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar I@@ I@@ " under@@ water.    
 Thank you very much.    
 H@@ i@@ . I'm K@@ ev@@ in Al@@ loc@@ ca, I'm the t@@ ren@@ ds manag@@ er at You@@ T@@ u@@ be, and I prof@@ es@@ sion@@ ally watch You@@ T@@ u@@ be vide@@ o@@ s.    
 It's tru@@ e.    
 So we're going to talk a little bit today about how vide@@ os go vi@@ ral and then why that even mat@@ ters.    
 We all want to be star@@ s -- c@@ ele@@ bri@@ ties, sing@@ ers, com@@ edi@@ ans -- and when I was youn@@ g@@ er, that seemed so very, very hard to do.    
 But now We@@ b video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do in a part of our world@@ 's cul@@ ture.    
 An@@ y one of you could be fam@@ ous on the Inter@@ net by next S@@ atur@@ day.    
 But there are over 4@@ 8 hours of video up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed to You@@ T@@ u@@ be every minut@@ e.    
 And of that, only a tiny perc@@ ent@@ age ever goes vi@@ ral and gets tons of view@@ s and becomes a cul@@ tural mom@@ ent.    
 So how does it happen@@ ?    
 Th@@ ree thing@@ s: ta@@ ste@@ ma@@ k@@ ers, communities of partici@@ pa@@ tion and u@@ nex@@ pec@@ te@@ d@@ n@@ ess.    
 All right, let's go.    
  B@@ ea@@ r V@@ as@@ qu@@ e@@ z@@ : O@@ h, my Go@@ d. O@@ h, my Go@@ d.    
 O@@ h, my Go@@ d@@ !    
 W@@ oo@@ o@@ !    
 O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h, w@@ ow@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ !    
 K@@ A: L@@ ast year, B@@ ea@@ r V@@ as@@ qu@@ e@@ z po@@ sted this video that he had sho@@ t outside his home in Y@@ o@@ se@@ m@@ ite Na@@ tional Par@@ k.    
 In 20@@ 10@@ , it was view@@ ed 2@@ 3 million times.    
   This is a char@@ t of what it looked like when it first became pop@@ ular last sum@@ mer@@ .    
 But he didn't actually set out to make a vi@@ ral vide@@ o, B@@ ear@@ .    
 He just wanted to share a ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w@@ .    
 Because that's what you do when your name is Y@@ o@@ se@@ m@@ ite M@@ oun@@ tain B@@ ear@@ .    
   And he had po@@ sted lots of nature vide@@ os in fac@@ t.    
 And this video had actually been po@@ sted all the way back in J@@ an@@ u@@ ary.    
 So what happened her@@ e?    
 J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l actu@@ ally.    
 J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l po@@ sted this t@@ we@@ et that would even@@ tu@@ ally pro@@ pe@@ l the video to be as pop@@ ular as it would be@@ com@@ e.    
 Because ta@@ ste@@ ma@@ k@@ ers like J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l intro@@ duce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larg@@ er audi@@ ence.    
  Re@@ be@@ cc@@ a B@@ l@@ ack@@ : ♫ It's Fri@@ day, Fri@@ day. Go@@ tt@@ a get down on Fri@@ day. ♫ ♫ Every@@ bod@@ y's looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end, wee@@ k@@ en@@ d. ♫ ♫ Fri@@ day, Fri@@ day. G@@ et@@ tin@@ ' down on Fri@@ day. ♫ K@@ A: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hop@@ e.    
 Re@@ be@@ cc@@ a B@@ l@@ ack@@ 's "@@ Fri@@ day@@ " is one of the most pop@@ ular vide@@ os of the year.    
 It's been seen nearly 2@@ 00 million times this year.    
 This is a char@@ t of what it looked lik@@ e.    
 And si@@ mil@@ ar to "D@@ ou@@ ble R@@ ain@@ bo@@ w@@ ," it seems to have just sp@@ rou@@ ted up out of no@@ wher@@ e.    
 So what happened on this da@@ y?    
 Well it was a Fri@@ day, this is tru@@ e.    
 And if you're wonder@@ ing about those other spi@@ k@@ es, those are also Fri@@ day@@ s.    
   But what about this day, this one particular Fri@@ da@@ y?    
 Well To@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 pic@@ ked it up, a lot of b@@ log@@ s starting writing ab@@ out.    
 M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el J@@ . N@@ el@@ son from M@@ y@@ ster@@ y S@@ ci@@ ence The@@ at@@ er was one of the first people to p@@ ost a jo@@ ke about the video on T@@ wit@@ ter.    
 But what's important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ ste@@ ma@@ k@@ ers took a point of view and they sha@@ red that with a larg@@ er audi@@ ence, acc@@ el@@ er@@ ating the proc@@ ess.    
 And so then this community for@@ med of people who sha@@ red this big inside jo@@ ke and they started talking about it and doing things with it.    
 And now there are 10@@ ,000 par@@ o@@ dies of "@@ Fri@@ day@@ " on You@@ T@@ u@@ be.    
 E@@ ven in the first seven days, there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the wee@@ k.    
   Un@@ like the one@@ -@@ way enter@@ tain@@ ment of the 20@@ th centur@@ y, this community partici@@ pa@@ tion is how we become a part of the ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on -- ei@@ ther by sp@@ reading it or by doing something new with it.    
   So "@@ N@@ y@@ an C@@ at@@ " is a lo@@ op@@ ed ani@@ ma@@ tion with lo@@ op@@ ed mus@@ ic.    
 It's this, just like this.    
 It's been view@@ ed nearly 50 million times this year.    
 And if you think that that is we@@ ir@@ d, you should know that there is a th@@ ree@@ -@@ hour ver@@ sion of this that's been view@@ ed four million times.    
   E@@ ven cat@@ s were watching this vide@@ o.    
   C@@ at@@ s were watching other cat@@ s watch this vide@@ o.    
   But what's important here is the creativ@@ ity that it inspi@@ red am@@ ong@@ st this tech@@ i@@ e, ge@@ e@@ k@@ y Inter@@ net cul@@ ture.    
 There were re@@ mi@@ x@@ es.    
   Some@@ one made an old ti@@ me@@ y ver@@ sion.    
   And then it went inter@@ na@@ tion@@ al.    
   A@@ n entire re@@ mi@@ x community sp@@ rou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stu@@ pi@@ d jo@@ ke to something that we can all actually be a part of.    
 Because we don't just en@@ jo@@ y now, we partici@@ pat@@ e.    
 And who could have pre@@ dic@@ ted any of this?    
 Who could have pre@@ dic@@ ted "D@@ ou@@ ble R@@ ain@@ bo@@ w@@ " or Re@@ be@@ cc@@ a B@@ l@@ ack or "@@ N@@ y@@ an C@@ at@@ ?"    
 What sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts could you have writ@@ ten that would have con@@ tain@@ ed this in it?    
 In a world where over two days of video get up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed every minut@@ e, only that which is truly unique and u@@ nex@@ pec@@ ted can stand out in the way that these things ha@@ ve.    
 When a friend of m@@ ine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy pro@@ tes@@ ting b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle fin@@ es in New York C@@ ity, I adm@@ it I wasn't very interes@@ ted.    
  C@@ as@@ ey N@@ i@@ est@@ at@@ : So I got a tic@@ ket for not ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e, but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from proper@@ ly ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e.    
   K@@ A: By being totally surpri@@ sing and hu@@ mor@@ ous, C@@ as@@ ey N@@ i@@ est@@ at got his fun@@ ny idea and point seen five million times.    
 And so this appro@@ ach hol@@ ds for anything new that we do creativ@@ el@@ y.    
 And so it all br@@ ings us to one big question ...    
  B@@ ea@@ r V@@ as@@ qu@@ e@@ z@@ : What does this mean@@ ?    
 O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h.    
   K@@ A: What does it mean@@ ?    
 T@@ a@@ ste@@ ma@@ k@@ ers, creative partici@@ p@@ ating communi@@ ties, comple@@ te u@@ nex@@ pec@@ te@@ d@@ ness, these are charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has acc@@ ess and the audi@@ ence defin@@ es the pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity.    
 I mean, as men@@ tion@@ ed earli@@ er, one of the biggest star@@ s in the world right now, J@@ us@@ ti@@ n B@@ i@@ eb@@ er, got his start on You@@ T@@ u@@ be.    
 No one has to gre@@ en@@ -@@ light your idea@@ .    
 And we all now feel some ow@@ ner@@ ship in our own po@@ p cul@@ ture.    
 And these are not charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of old medi@@ a, and they're b@@ are@@ ly tru@@ e of the media of today, but they will def@@ ine the enter@@ tain@@ ment of the fu@@ ture.    
 Thank you.     
 How can I speak in 10 minut@@ es about the bon@@ ds of women over three gener@@ a@@ tions, about how the ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing st@@ ren@@ g@@ th of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sist@@ er, her mother and her grand@@ mother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small bo@@ at in the Chin@@ a Se@@ a more than 30 years ago, bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl    
 and never let go -- that small girl now living in S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o and spea@@ king to you to@@ da@@ y?    
 This is not a fin@@ ish@@ ed story.    
 It is a j@@ ig@@ saw pu@@ z@@ z@@ le still being put together.    
 L@@ et me tell you about some of the piec@@ es.    
 I@@ mag@@ ine the first piec@@ e: a man bur@@ ning his life@@ 's work.    
 He is a po@@ e@@ t, a play@@ w@@ right, a man wh@@ ose whole life had been bal@@ anc@@ ed on the single hope of his countr@@ y's un@@ ity and fre@@ ed@@ om@@ .    
 I@@ mag@@ ine him as the commun@@ ists ent@@ er S@@ a@@ ig@@ on, conf@@ ron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a comple@@ te wa@@ st@@ e.    
 W@@ ord@@ s, for so long his friends, now mo@@ c@@ ked him.    
 He re@@ tre@@ ated into sil@@ ence.    
 He died bro@@ ken by hi@@ story.    
 He is my grand@@ father@@ .    
 I never knew him in real life.    
 But our lives are much more than our memor@@ ies.    
 My grand@@ mother never let me for@@ get his life.    
 My du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in v@@ ain@@ , and my less@@ on was to learn that, y@@ es, history tried to cr@@ us@@ h us, but we end@@ u@@ re@@ d.    
 The next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a bo@@ at in the ear@@ ly da@@ w@@ n sli@@ pp@@ ing sil@@ ently out to se@@ a.    
 My mother@@ , Ma@@ i@@ , was 1@@ 8 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged mar@@ ri@@ age, already with two small girl@@ s.    
 For her, life had di@@ sti@@ l@@ led itself into one t@@ as@@ k@@ : the es@@ cap@@ e of her family and a new life in A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a.    
 It was in@@ con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ able to her that she would not succ@@ e@@ ed.    
 So after a four@@ -@@ year sa@@ g@@ a that de@@ fi@@ es fic@@ tion, a bo@@ at sli@@ pped out to se@@ a dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as a fish@@ ing v@@ es@@ sel@@ .    
 All the adul@@ ts knew the risk@@ s.    
 The greatest fe@@ ar was of p@@ ir@@ ates, ra@@ pe and dea@@ th.    
 Li@@ ke most adul@@ ts on the bo@@ at, my mother car@@ ried a small bo@@ t@@ tle of po@@ is@@ on.    
 If we were cap@@ ture@@ d, first my si@@ ster and I@@ , then she and my grand@@ mother would d@@ rin@@ k.    
 My first memor@@ ies are from the bo@@ at -- the ste@@ ad@@ y be@@ at of the eng@@ ine, the b@@ ow di@@ pp@@ ing into each wa@@ ve, the v@@ ast and emp@@ ty hor@@ iz@@ on.    
 I don't remember the p@@ ir@@ ates who came many times, but were bl@@ u@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our bo@@ at, or the eng@@ ine d@@ ying and fail@@ ing to start for six hour@@ s.    
 But I do remember the li@@ ghts on the o@@ il ri@@ g off the M@@ al@@ ay@@ si@@ an co@@ ast and the young man who col@@ la@@ p@@ sed and di@@ ed, the jour@@ ne@@ y's end too much for him, and the first app@@ le I ta@@ st@@ ed, given to me by the men on the ri@@ g@@ .    
 No app@@ le has ever ta@@ sted the sam@@ e.    
 Af@@ ter three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp@@ , we lan@@ ded in M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ n@@ e.    
 And the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three gener@@ ations sha@@ ping a new life together.    
 We se@@ tt@@ led in F@@ oo@@ t@@ sc@@ ra@@ y, a work@@ ing@@ -@@ class sub@@ ur@@ b wh@@ ose demo@@ graph@@ ic is lay@@ ers of im@@ mi@@ gran@@ ts.    
 Un@@ like the se@@ tt@@ led m@@ idd@@ le@@ -@@ class sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s, there was no sense of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment in F@@ oo@@ t@@ sc@@ ra@@ y.    
 The sm@@ ell@@ s from sho@@ p do@@ ors were from the rest of the world.    
 And the s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of hal@@ ting Eng@@ lish were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in com@@ mon@@ , they were starting again.    
 My mother worked on far@@ ms, then on a car as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly lin@@ e, working six days, d@@ ou@@ ble shi@@ f@@ ts.    
 Some@@ how she found time to study Eng@@ lish and ga@@ in I@@ T qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ca@@ tions.    
 We were po@@ or.    
 All the dollars were al@@ loc@@ ated and ex@@ tr@@ a tui@@ tion in Eng@@ lish and ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tics was bu@@ d@@ ge@@ ted for re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what mis@@ sed out, which was usually new clo@@ thes@@ ; they were always secon@@ d@@ han@@ d.    
 Tw@@ o pa@@ ir@@ s of st@@ oc@@ k@@ ings for school, each to h@@ ide the hol@@ es in the other.    
 A school uni@@ form down to the an@@ k@@ l@@ es, because it had to last for six years.    
 And there were r@@ are but se@@ aring chan@@ ts of "@@ s@@ lit@@ -@@ e@@ ye@@ " and the oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ al gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ : "A@@ si@@ an, go home@@ ."    
 G@@ o home to wher@@ e?    
 Some@@ thing sti@@ ff@@ ened inside me.    
 There was a ga@@ ther@@ ing of res@@ ol@@ ve and a qui@@ et vo@@ ice say@@ ing, "I will by@@ pas@@ s you@@ ."    
 My mother@@ , my si@@ ster and I sle@@ p@@ t in the same be@@ d.    
 My mother was ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted each night, but we told one another about our day and list@@ ened to the mov@@ em@@ ents of my grand@@ mother around the hous@@ e.    
 My mother suffer@@ ed from ni@@ ght@@ ma@@ res all about the bo@@ at.    
 And my job was to sta@@ y a@@ wa@@ ke until her ni@@ ght@@ ma@@ res came so I could wa@@ ke her@@ .    
 She op@@ ened a computer store then stu@@ died to be a beau@@ tici@@ an and op@@ ened another busin@@ ess.    
 And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the tran@@ si@@ tion, an@@ gr@@ y and in@@ f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ b@@ le, and tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed children caught between two worl@@ ds.    
 G@@ ran@@ ts and spon@@ sor@@ s were sou@@ ght.    
 C@@ ent@@ ers were es@@ tab@@ li@@ sh@@ ed.    
 I li@@ ved in par@@ al@@ le@@ l worl@@ ds.    
 In one, I was the clas@@ si@@ c A@@ si@@ an stud@@ ent, rel@@ ent@@ less in the de@@ man@@ ds that I made on my@@ self.    
 In the other@@ , I was en@@ mes@@ h@@ ed in lives that were p@@ rec@@ ari@@ ous, tra@@ g@@ ically sc@@ ar@@ red by viol@@ ence, d@@ ru@@ g ab@@ use and is@@ ol@@ ation.    
 But so many over the years were hel@@ pe@@ d.    
 And for that work, when I was a fin@@ al year la@@ w stud@@ ent, I was ch@@ os@@ en as the young A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ an of the year.    
 And I was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to an@@ other@@ , and their ed@@ g@@ es didn't f@@ it.    
 T@@ an L@@ e, an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous F@@ oo@@ t@@ sc@@ ra@@ y resid@@ ent, was now T@@ an L@@ e, re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ st, inv@@ ited to speak in ven@@ u@@ es she had never heard of and into hom@@ es wh@@ ose exist@@ ence she could never have imagin@@ ed.    
 I didn't know the pro@@ to@@ col@@ s.    
 I didn't know how to use the cu@@ t@@ l@@ er@@ y.    
 I didn't know how to talk about win@@ e.    
 I didn't know how to talk about any@@ thing.    
 I wanted to re@@ tre@@ at to the rou@@ tin@@ es and comfor@@ t of life in an un@@ sun@@ g sub@@ ur@@ b -- a grand@@ mother@@ , a mother and two daugh@@ ters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and f@@ all@@ ing as@@ le@@ ep@@ , the three of us still in the same be@@ d.    
 I told my mother I couldn't do it.    
 She re@@ min@@ ded me that I was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the bo@@ at.    
 No had never been an op@@ tion.    
 "@@ Just do it@@ ," she said, "@@ and don't be what you're no@@ t@@ ."    
 So I spo@@ ke out on you@@ th u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment and edu@@ cation and the ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct of the mar@@ g@@ in@@ al@@ ized and the di@@ sen@@ f@@ ran@@ chi@@ se@@ d.    
 And the more can@@ di@@ d@@ ly I spo@@ ke, the more I was asked to spea@@ k.    
 I met people from all wal@@ ks of life, so many of them doing the thing they lo@@ v@@ ed, living on the f@@ ron@@ ti@@ ers of possib@@ ility.    
 And even though I fin@@ ish@@ ed my degre@@ e, I realized I could not se@@ t@@ tle into a care@@ er in law@@ .    
 There had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ sa@@ w@@ .    
 And I realized at the same time that it is oka@@ y to be an out@@ sid@@ er, a recent arri@@ v@@ al, new on the scen@@ e -- and not just oka@@ y, but something to be th@@ an@@ k@@ ful for@@ , perhaps a gi@@ ft from the bo@@ at.    
 Because being an insid@@ er can so eas@@ ily mean col@@ la@@ p@@ sing the hor@@ iz@@ on@@ s, can so eas@@ ily mean acc@@ ep@@ ting the pre@@ su@@ mp@@ tions of your pro@@ v@@ inc@@ e.    
 I have ste@@ pped outside my comfor@@ t z@@ one enough now to know that, y@@ es, the world does f@@ all a@@ par@@ t, but not in the way that you fear@@ .    
 P@@ os@@ si@@ bili@@ ties that would not have been allow@@ ed were ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ously en@@ coura@@ ge@@ d.    
 There was an energy there, an imp@@ la@@ ca@@ ble op@@ tim@@ ism, a str@@ ange mi@@ x@@ ture of hu@@ m@@ ility and dar@@ ing.    
 So I follow@@ ed my hun@@ ch@@ es.    
 I ga@@ ther@@ ed around me a small team of people for who@@ m the la@@ be@@ l "@@ It can't be don@@ e@@ " was an ir@@ re@@ si@@ sti@@ ble challeng@@ e.    
 For a year we were pen@@ n@@ il@@ ess.    
 At the end of each day, I made a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p which we all sha@@ re@@ d.    
 We worked well into each ni@@ ght.    
 M@@ ost of our ideas were craz@@ y, but a few were br@@ illi@@ ant, and we bro@@ ke through@@ .    
 I made the deci@@ sion to move to the U.S.    
 after only one tri@@ p.    
 My hun@@ ch@@ es again.    
 Th@@ ree months later I had re@@ lo@@ cat@@ ed, and the ad@@ ven@@ ture has contin@@ u@@ ed.    
 Be@@ fore I close thou@@ gh, let me tell you about my grand@@ mother@@ .    
 She grew up at a time when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local Man@@ dar@@ in was the person who mat@@ ter@@ ed.    
 Li@@ fe ha@@ dn't changed for cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es.    
 H@@ er father died soon after she was bor@@ n.    
 H@@ er mother rais@@ ed her al@@ one.    
 At 1@@ 7 she became the second wi@@ fe of a Man@@ dar@@ in wh@@ ose mother be@@ at her@@ .    
 With no supp@@ ort from her h@@ us@@ b@@ and, she ca@@ used a sen@@ sa@@ tion by taking him to cour@@ t and pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ting her own case, and a far great@@ er sen@@ sa@@ tion when she w@@ on.    
     "@@ It can't be don@@ e@@ " was shown to be wr@@ ong@@ .    
 I was taking a show@@ er in a ho@@ te@@ l room in S@@ y@@ d@@ ney 6@@ 00 miles away in M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ n@@ e.    
 I looked through the show@@ er scre@@ en and saw her standing on the other sid@@ e.    
 I knew she had come to say goo@@ d@@ by@@ e.    
 My mother ph@@ on@@ ed minut@@ es lat@@ er.    
 A few days later, we went to a Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in F@@ oo@@ t@@ sc@@ ra@@ y and s@@ at around her cas@@ ke@@ t.    
 We told her stories and as@@ su@@ red her that we were still with her@@ .    
 At m@@ id@@ ni@@ ght the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ke@@ t.    
 My mother asked us to feel her han@@ d.    
 She asked the mon@@ k, "@@ Why is it that her hand is so war@@ m and the rest of her is so col@@ d@@ ?"    
 "@@ Because you have been hol@@ ding it since this mor@@ n@@ ing@@ ," he said@@ .    
 "@@ You have not let it go@@ ."    
 If there is a sin@@ ew in our family, it run@@ s through the wom@@ en.    
 G@@ i@@ ven who we were and how life had sha@@ ped us, we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us.    
 D@@ e@@ fe@@ at would have come too eas@@ il@@ y.    
 Now I would like to have my own children, and I won@@ der about the bo@@ at.    
 Who could ever w@@ ish it on their ow@@ n@@ ?    
 Y@@ et I am afraid of pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ e, of eas@@ e, of enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment.    
 Can I give them a b@@ ow in their liv@@ es, di@@ pp@@ ing bra@@ vel@@ y into each wa@@ ve, the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and ste@@ ad@@ y be@@ at of the eng@@ ine, the v@@ ast hor@@ iz@@ on that gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es no@@ thing@@ ?    
 I don't know.    
 But if I could give it and still see them sa@@ f@@ ely through@@ , I w@@ oul@@ d.    
   T@@ re@@ v@@ or N@@ e@@ il@@ son@@ : And al@@ so, T@@ an@@ 's mother is here today in the four@@ th or fi@@ f@@ th row@@ .    
 My story beg@@ ins right here actually in R@@ a@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago.    
 I was in the deser@@ t, under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the Su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er M@@ u@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar A@@ li@@ .    
 And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indi@@ an epic "The Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ at@@ a@@ ."    
 So back in the day, when us Indi@@ ans wanted to tra@@ vel we@@ 'd ju@@ m@@ p into a char@@ i@@ o@@ t and we@@ 'd z@@ oo@@ m across the sk@@ y.    
 Now we do the same with air@@ plan@@ es.    
 B@@ ack then, when Ar@@ j@@ un@@ a, the great Indi@@ an war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce, when he was th@@ ir@@ st@@ y, he@@ 'd take out a bo@@ w@@ , he@@ 'd sh@@ oo@@ t it into the grou@@ nd and water would come out.    
 Now we do the same with d@@ r@@ ill@@ s and mach@@ in@@ es.    
 The con@@ cl@@ usi@@ on that we came to was that magic had been re@@ plac@@ ed by mach@@ in@@ er@@ y.    
 And this made me really sa@@ d.    
 I found myself be@@ coming a little bit of a techno@@ pho@@ be.    
 I was terri@@ fied by this idea that I would lo@@ se the ability to en@@ jo@@ y and app@@ reci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me, without t@@ wee@@ ting it to my friend@@ s.    
 And it felt like technology should en@@ able mag@@ ic, not kill it.    
 When I was a little girl@@ , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ c@@ ket wat@@ ch.    
 And this piece of 5@@ 0@@ -year-old technology became the most ma@@ gi@@ cal thing to me.    
 It became a g@@ il@@ ded g@@ at@@ e@@ way into a world full of p@@ ir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ ks and images in my imagin@@ ation.    
 So I felt like our cell@@ ph@@ ones and our f@@ anc@@ y wat@@ ch@@ es and our camer@@ as had stopped us from dre@@ am@@ ing.    
 They stopped us from being inspi@@ re@@ d.    
 And so I ju@@ mp@@ ed in, I ju@@ mp@@ ed into this world of technology, to see how I could use it to en@@ able magic as op@@ pos@@ ed to kill it.    
 I've been ill@@ u@@ str@@ ating books since I was 1@@ 6@@ .    
 And so when I saw the i@@ P@@ a@@ d, I saw it as a stor@@ y@@ telling de@@ vice that could con@@ ne@@ ct read@@ ers all over the world.    
 It can know how we're hol@@ ding it.    
 It can know where we are.    
 It br@@ ings together image and t@@ ext and ani@@ ma@@ tion and sound and tou@@ ch.    
 S@@ tor@@ y@@ telling is be@@ coming more and more multi@@ -@@ sen@@ sor@@ i@@ al.    
 But what are we doing with it?    
 So I'm actually just going to go in and la@@ unch K@@ ho@@ y@@ a, an interac@@ tive ap@@ p for the i@@ P@@ a@@ d.    
 So it says, "@@ P@@ l@@ ace your fing@@ ers up@@ on each light@@ ."    
 And so -- It says, "@@ This bo@@ x bel@@ ong@@ s to ... " And so I type in my nam@@ e.    
 And actually I become a charac@@ ter in the boo@@ k.    
 At vari@@ ous poin@@ ts, a little let@@ ter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the i@@ P@@ ad knows where you live because of G@@ P@@ S -- which is actually ad@@ dres@@ sed to me.    
 The child in me is really exc@@ ited by these kinds of possibili@@ ties.    
 Now I've been talking a lot about mag@@ ic.    
 And I don't mean w@@ iz@@ ar@@ ds and dra@@ g@@ on@@ s, I mean the kind of child@@ hood mag@@ ic, those ideas that we all har@@ bo@@ red as children@@ .    
 This idea of fi@@ ref@@ li@@ es in a j@@ ar, for some reas@@ on, was always really exc@@ iting to me.    
 And so over here you need to til@@ t your i@@ P@@ a@@ d, take the fi@@ ref@@ li@@ es out.    
 And they actually ill@@ u@@ min@@ ate your way through the rest of the boo@@ k.    
 A@@ no@@ ther idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y could be con@@ tain@@ ed within a single mar@@ b@@ le.    
 And so over here, each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that I dra@@ g in to this ma@@ gi@@ cal de@@ vice within the de@@ vic@@ e.    
 And it op@@ en@@ s up a ma@@ p.    
 All al@@ ong, all f@@ ant@@ as@@ y books have always had ma@@ ps, but these ma@@ ps have been sta@@ tic.    
 This is a ma@@ p that grow@@ s and g@@ low@@ s and becomes your na@@ vi@@ g@@ ation for the rest of the boo@@ k.    
 It re@@ ve@@ als itself to you at certain poin@@ ts in the book as well.    
 So I'm just going to ent@@ er in.    
 A@@ no@@ ther thing that's actually really important to me is creating cont@@ ent that is Indi@@ an and yet very contemp@@ or@@ ary.    
 O@@ ver here, these are the A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as@@ .    
 So we've all heard about fa@@ i@@ ri@@ es and we've all heard about n@@ y@@ mp@@ h@@ s, but how many people outside of Indi@@ a know about their Indi@@ an coun@@ ter@@ par@@ ts, the A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as@@ ?    
 These po@@ or A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as have been tra@@ pped inside In@@ dra@@ 's cha@@ mb@@ ers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ st@@ y boo@@ k.    
 And so we're br@@ ing@@ ing them back in a contemp@@ or@@ ary story for children@@ .    
 And a story that actually de@@ als with new issu@@ es like the environ@@ mental cri@@ si@@ s.    
   S@@ pe@@ a@@ king of the environ@@ mental cri@@ si@@ s, I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been loc@@ ked inside their room@@ s, g@@ lu@@ ed to their P@@ C@@ s, they haven't been able to get out.    
 But now with mobile technology, we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technolog@@ y.    
 One of the interac@@ tions in the book is that you're sent off on this qu@@ est take out your camera on the i@@ P@@ ad and colle@@ ct pictures of different natural objec@@ ts.    
 When I was a chil@@ d, I had multi@@ ple collec@@ tions of s@@ tic@@ ks and st@@ ones and pe@@ b@@ bl@@ es and sh@@ ell@@ s.    
 And some@@ how kids don't do that any@@ more.    
 So in br@@ ing@@ ing back this child@@ hood r@@ itu@@ al, you need to go out and, in one cha@@ p@@ ter, take a picture of a flow@@ er and then ta@@ g it.    
 In another cha@@ p@@ ter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then ta@@ g that.    
 And what happens is that you actually create a digital collec@@ tion of photograph@@ s that you can then put up on@@ lin@@ e.    
 A child in L@@ on@@ d@@ on pu@@ ts up a picture of a f@@ o@@ x and says, "O@@ h, I saw a f@@ o@@ x to@@ day@@ ."    
 A child in Indi@@ a says, "I saw a mon@@ key to@@ day@@ ."    
 And it cre@@ ates this kind of social net@@ work around a collec@@ tion of digital photograph@@ s that you've actually ta@@ k@@ en. In the possibili@@ ties of lin@@ king together mag@@ ic, the ear@@ th and technology, there are multi@@ ple possibili@@ ties.    
 In the next book, we pl@@ an on having an interac@@ tion where you take your i@@ P@@ ad out with the video on and through augmented real@@ ity, you see this lay@@ er of anim@@ ated pix@@ ies appe@@ ar on a h@@ ou@@ se@@ plant that's outside your hous@@ e.    
 At one poin@@ t, your scre@@ en is f@@ ill@@ ed up with lea@@ v@@ es.    
 And so you need to make the sound of w@@ ind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the boo@@ k.    
 We're mov@@ ing, we're all moving here, to a world where the forc@@ es of nature come clo@@ s@@ er together to technology, and magic and technology can come clo@@ s@@ er together.    
 We're har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing energy from the sun@@ .    
 We're br@@ ing@@ ing our children and ourselves clo@@ s@@ er to the natural world and that magic and jo@@ y and child@@ hood love that we had through the simple medi@@ um of a story.    
 Thank you.    
 I would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projec@@ ts fail@@ .    
 And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped list@@ ening to pati@@ ents.    
 And one of the things we did at R@@ ad@@ b@@ oud U@@ ni@@ versity is we ap@@ poin@@ ted a chi@@ ef list@@ ening offic@@ er.    
 Not in a very scientific way -- she pu@@ ts up a little c@@ up of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e or c@@ up of te@@ a and as@@ ks pati@@ ents, family, rela@@ tiv@@ es, "@@ What's up@@ ?    
 How could we help you@@ ?"    
 And we think, we like to think, that this is one of the maj@@ or problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projec@@ ts fa@@ il, since we stopped list@@ en@@ ing.    
 This is my Wi@@ F@@ i scal@@ e. It's a very simple thing.    
 It's got one kno@@ b@@ , on@@ /@@ off.    
 And every mor@@ ning I ho@@ p on it.    
 And y@@ es, I've got a challeng@@ e, as you might se@@ e.    
 And I put my challenge on 9@@ 5 k@@ g@@ .    
 But the thing is that it's made this simple that wh@@ en@@ ever I ho@@ p on, it sen@@ ds my data through Goog@@ le H@@ e@@ al@@ th as well.    
 And it's collec@@ ted by my gener@@ al prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er as well, so he can see what's my problem in we@@ i@@ ght, not on the very moment that I need car@@ di@@ o@@ logi@@ c supp@@ ort or something like it, but also looking back@@ war@@ d.    
 But there's another thing.    
 As some of you might know, I've got more than 4@@ ,000 follow@@ ers on T@@ wit@@ ter.    
 So every mor@@ ning I ho@@ p on my Wi@@ F@@ i scale and before I'm in my car@@ , people start talking to me, "I think you need a light l@@ unch today, L@@ u@@ ci@@ en@@ ."    
   But that's the n@@ ic@@ est thing that could happen@@ , since this is pe@@ er pres@@ su@@ re, pe@@ er pres@@ sure used to help pati@@ ents -- since this could be used for ob@@ es@@ ity, it could be used to stop s@@ mo@@ king in pati@@ ents.    
 But on the other han@@ d, it also could be used to get people from out of their cha@@ ir@@ s and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing ac@@ tiv@@ ity to get more control of their heal@@ th.    
 As of next wee@@ k, it will soon be avail@@ able.    
 There will be this little blood pres@@ sure me@@ ter connec@@ ted to an i@@ P@@ h@@ one or something or other.    
 And people will be able, from their hom@@ es, to take their blood pres@@ su@@ re, s@@ end it into their doctor and even@@ tu@@ ally share it with other@@ s, for instan@@ ce, for over a hundred dollar@@ s.    
 And this is the point where pati@@ ents get into posi@@ tion and can collec@@ t, not only their own control again, be cap@@ tain of their own shi@@ p, but also can help us in health care du@@ e to the challeng@@ es that we fac@@ e, like health care cost explo@@ sion, d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed de@@ m@@ and and things like that.    
 Ma@@ ke techniques that are easy to use and start with this to em@@ br@@ ace pati@@ ents in the te@@ am.    
 And you can do this with techniques like this, but also by c@@ row@@ d-@@ sour@@ c@@ ing.    
 And one of the things we did I would like to share with you intro@@ duc@@ ed by a little vide@@ o.    
   We've all got na@@ vi@@ g@@ ation contro@@ ls in our car@@ .    
 We maybe even [@@ ha@@ ve@@ ] it in our cell@@ ph@@ one.    
 We know perfec@@ tly where all the A@@ T@@ M@@ s are about the city of Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ ch@@ t.    
 The other thing is we know where all the g@@ as sta@@ tions are.    
 And su@@ re, we could find fast food cha@@ in@@ s.    
 But where would be the ne@@ are@@ st A@@ E@@ D to help this pati@@ ent@@ ?    
 We asked around and no@@ body k@@ new@@ .    
 No@@ body knew where the ne@@ are@@ st life@@ -@@ sa@@ ving A@@ E@@ D was to be ob@@ tain@@ ed right now.    
 So what we di@@ d, we c@@ row@@ d@@ sour@@ c@@ ed The N@@ e@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds.    
 We set up a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite and asked the c@@ row@@ d, "@@ If you see an A@@ E@@ D@@ , please sub@@ m@@ it it, tell us where it is, tell us when it's op@@ en@@ ," since sometimes in off@@ ice hours sometimes it's close@@ d, of cour@@ se.    
 And over 10@@ ,000 A@@ E@@ D@@ s already in The N@@ e@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds already have been sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted.    
 The next step we took was to find the appli@@ cations for it.    
 And we built an i@@ P@@ ad appli@@ ca@@ tion.    
 We made an appli@@ cation for L@@ ay@@ ar, augmented real@@ ity, to find these A@@ E@@ D@@ s.    
 And wh@@ en@@ ever you are in a city like Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ ch@@ t and somebody col@@ la@@ p@@ s@@ es, you can use your i@@ P@@ h@@ one, and within the next weeks also run your M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft cell@@ ph@@ one, to find the ne@@ are@@ st A@@ E@@ D which can save lives.    
 And as of today, we would like to intro@@ duce this, not only as A@@ E@@ D@@ 4@@ E@@ U@@ , which is what the produc@@ t is cal@@ le@@ d, but also A@@ E@@ D@@ 4@@ U@@ S.    
 And we would like to start this on a world@@ w@@ ide level@@ .    
 And [@@ we@@ '@@ re@@ ] asking all of our colleag@@ u@@ es in the rest of the world, colleag@@ ue univer@@ si@@ ties, to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to c@@ row@@ d-@@ sour@@ ce all these A@@ E@@ D@@ s all around the world.    
 That wh@@ en@@ ever you're on ho@@ li@@ day and somebody col@@ la@@ p@@ s@@ es, might it be your own rela@@ tive or someone just in front of you, you can find this.    
 The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us val@@ id@@ ate these A@@ E@@ D@@ s.    
 These might be cou@@ ri@@ er services or ca@@ ble guys for instan@@ ce, just to see whether the A@@ E@@ D that's sub@@ m@@ it@@ ted still is in plac@@ e.    
 So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit bet@@ ter, but take control of it.    
 Thank you.    
 I'm here to share my photograph@@ y.    
 Or is it photo@@ gra@@ phy@@ ?    
 Be@@ cause, of course, this is a photo@@ gra@@ p@@ h that you can't take with your camer@@ a.    
 Y@@ e@@ t, my inter@@ est in photograph@@ y started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 1@@ 5@@ .    
 It mi@@ x@@ ed with my earli@@ er passion for dra@@ w@@ ing, but it was a bit differ@@ ent, because using the camer@@ a, the process was in the plan@@ ning instea@@ d.    
 And when you take a photo@@ gra@@ p@@ h with a camer@@ a, the process ends when you pres@@ s the tri@@ gg@@ er.    
 So to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time.    
 I felt like anyone could do that.    
 So I wanted to create something differ@@ ent, something where the process starts when you pres@@ s the tri@@ gg@@ er.    
 P@@ ho@@ to@@ s like this: construc@@ tion going on along a bus@@ y roa@@ d. But it has an u@@ nex@@ pec@@ ted tw@@ ist@@ .    
 And des@@ p@@ ite that, it re@@ tain@@ s a level of real@@ ism.    
 Or photos like these -- both dar@@ k and color@@ ful, but all with a comm@@ on goal of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of real@@ ism.    
 When I say real@@ ism, I mean photo@@ -@@ real@@ ism.    
 Be@@ cause, of course, it's not something you can cap@@ ture re@@ ally, but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ ture@@ d some@@ how as a photograph@@ .    
 P@@ ho@@ to@@ s where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the tric@@ k.    
 So it's more about cap@@ tur@@ ing an idea But what's the tri@@ ck that makes it look real@@ is@@ tic@@ ?    
 Is it something about the deta@@ ils or the color@@ s?    
 Is it something about the li@@ ght?    
 What cre@@ ates the ill@@ usi@@ on@@ ?    
 Some@@ times the perspec@@ tive is the ill@@ usi@@ on.    
 But in the end, it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a tw@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al sur@@ fac@@ e.    
 It's not really what is real@@ is@@ tic@@ , it's what we think looks real@@ istic re@@ ally.    
 So I think the bas@@ ics are quite simp@@ le.    
 I just see it as a pu@@ z@@ z@@ le of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alter@@ n@@ ate real@@ ity.    
 And let me show you a simple examp@@ le.    
 Here we have three perfec@@ tly imagin@@ able physical objec@@ ts, something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al world.    
 But comb@@ ined in a certain way, they can create something that still looks th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al, like it could exist@@ .    
 But at the same time, we know it can@@ '@@ t.    
 So we tri@@ ck our bra@@ in@@ s, because our brain simply doesn't acc@@ ept the fact that it doesn't really make sen@@ se.    
 And I see the same process with comb@@ ining photograph@@ s.    
 It's just really about comb@@ ining different real@@ i@@ ties.    
 So the things that make a photo@@ gra@@ p@@ h look real@@ is@@ tic@@ , I think it's the things that we don't even think ab@@ out, the things all around us in our da@@ ily lives.    
 But when comb@@ ining photograph@@ s, this is really important to consid@@ er, because other@@ w@@ ise it just looks wrong some@@ h@@ ow@@ .    
 So I would like to say that there are three simple rul@@ es to follow to achi@@ eve a real@@ istic resul@@ t.    
 As you can see, these images aren't really speci@@ al.    
 But comb@@ in@@ ed, they can create something like this.    
 So the first ru@@ le is that photos comb@@ ined should have the same perspec@@ tive.    
 S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly, photos comb@@ ined should have the same type of li@@ ght.    
 And these two images both ful@@ f@@ ill these two re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments -- sho@@ t at the same he@@ ight and in the same type of li@@ ght.    
 The third one is about making it impos@@ sible to dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ l@@ ess. Ma@@ ke it impos@@ sible to say how the image actually was com@@ po@@ se@@ d.    
 So by mat@@ ching col@@ or, con@@ tr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the b@@ ord@@ ers between the different imag@@ es, ad@@ ding photograph@@ ic de@@ fec@@ ts like dep@@ th of fiel@@ d, des@@ atur@@ ated col@@ ors and no@@ is@@ e, we er@@ ase the b@@ ord@@ ers between the different images and make it look like one single imag@@ e, des@@ p@@ ite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of lay@@ ers bas@@ ic@@ ally.    
 So here's another examp@@ le.    
   One might think that this is just an image of a lan@@ ds@@ cap@@ e and the low@@ er part is what's man@@ i@@ pul@@ ated.    
 But this image is actually enti@@ rely comp@@ osed of photograph@@ s from different lo@@ ca@@ tions.    
 I person@@ ally think that it's eas@@ i@@ er to actually create a place than to find a plac@@ e, because then you don't need to comp@@ rom@@ ise with the ideas in your hea@@ d.    
 But it does re@@ qui@@ re a lot of plan@@ n@@ ing.    
 And getting this idea during w@@ inter@@ , I knew that I had several months to pl@@ an it, to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le bas@@ ic@@ ally.    
 So for example, the fish was cap@@ ture@@ d on a fish@@ ing tri@@ p.    
 The sh@@ ore@@ s are from a different lo@@ ca@@ tion.    
 The under@@ water part was cap@@ ture@@ d in a st@@ one p@@ it.    
 And yea@@ h, I even turned the house on top of the is@@ land red to make it look more S@@ we@@ dish@@ .    
 So to achi@@ eve a real@@ istic resul@@ t, I think it comes down to plan@@ n@@ ing.    
 It always starts with a s@@ ke@@ t@@ ch, an idea@@ .    
 Then it's about comb@@ ining the different photograph@@ s.    
 And here every piece is very well plan@@ ne@@ d.    
 And if you do a good job cap@@ tur@@ ing the photo@@ s, the result can be quite beautiful and also quite real@@ is@@ tic.    
 So all the tools are out there, and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our imagin@@ ation.    
 Thank you.    
 Because I usually take the ro@@ le of trying to explain to people how wonder@@ ful the new technologi@@ es that are coming along are going to be, and I thought that, since I was am@@ ong friends here, I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing ju@@ mp@@ s in technology that seem so fast that we can b@@ are@@ ly keep on top of it.    
 So I'm going to start out by showing just one very bor@@ ing technology sli@@ de.    
 And then, so if you can just turn on the sli@@ de that's on.    
 This is just a ran@@ dom sli@@ de that I pic@@ ked out of my fi@@ le.    
 What I want to show you is not so much the deta@@ ils of the sli@@ de, but the gener@@ al form of it.    
 This happens to be a sli@@ de of some an@@ aly@@ sis that we were doing about the power of R@@ I@@ S@@ C micro@@ process@@ ors ver@@ su@@ s the power of local area net@@ work@@ s.    
 And the interesting thing about it is that this sli@@ de, like so many technology sli@@ des that we're used to, is a sort of a stra@@ ight line on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve.    
 In other words, every step here re@@ pres@@ ents an order of mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de in perfor@@ man@@ ce scal@@ e. And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ v@@ es.    
 Some@@ thing really we@@ ird is going on here.    
 And that's basically what I'm going to be talking ab@@ out.    
 So, if you could bring up the light@@ s.    
 If you could bring up the li@@ ghts high@@ er, because I'm just going to use a piece of pa@@ per here.    
 Now why do we dra@@ w technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ v@@ es?    
 Well the answer is, if I dre@@ w it on a nor@@ mal cur@@ ve wher@@ e, let's say, this is years, this is time of some sor@@ t, and this is what@@ ever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph@@ , the graph@@ s look sort of s@@ ill@@ y.    
 They sort of go like this.    
 And they don't tell us much.    
 Now if I graph@@ , for instan@@ ce, some other technology, say transp@@ or@@ ta@@ tion technology, on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve, it would look very stu@@ p@@ id@@ , it would look like a fl@@ at lin@@ e.    
 But when something like this happen@@ s, things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively chang@@ ing.    
 So if transp@@ or@@ ta@@ tion technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ process@@ or technology, then the day after tom@@ or@@ row@@ , I would be able to get in a ta@@ x@@ i ca@@ b and be in To@@ k@@ y@@ o in 30 secon@@ ds.    
 It's not moving like that.    
 in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ fe@@ e@@ ding grow@@ th where you go by ord@@ ers of mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de every few years.    
 Now the question that I'd like to ask is, if you look at these exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ves, they don't go on fore@@ ver.    
 Th@@ ings just can't possib@@ ly keep changing as fast as they are.    
 One of two things is going to happen@@ .    
 until something totally different comes al@@ ong, or maybe it's going to do this.    
 That's about all it can do.    
 Now I'm an op@@ tim@@ ist@@ , so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.    
 If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a tran@@ si@@ tion.    
 We're sort of on this line in a tran@@ si@@ tion from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is.    
 And so what I'm trying to as@@ k, what I've been asking my@@ self, is what's this new way that the world is@@ ?    
 What's that new state that the world is head@@ ing to@@ war@@ d?    
 Because the tran@@ si@@ tion seems very, very conf@@ using when we're right in the middle of it.    
 Now when I was a kid growing up, the future was kind of the year 200@@ 0, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 200@@ 0@@ .    
 Now here's a conf@@ er@@ ence in which people talk about the fu@@ ture, and you no@@ tice that the future is still at about the year 200@@ 0@@ .    
 It's about as far as we go out.    
 So in other words, the future has kind of been sh@@ rin@@ king one year per year for my whole life@@ time.    
 Now I think that the reason that some@@ thing@@ 's happen@@ ing there.    
 That tran@@ si@@ tion is happen@@ ing. We can all sense it.    
 And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense to think out 3@@ 0, 50 years because every@@ thing@@ 's going to be so different that a simple extra@@ pol@@ ation of what we're doing just doesn't make any sense at all.    
 So what I would like to talk about what that tran@@ si@@ tion could be that we're going through@@ .    
 Now in order to do that I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and compu@@ ters.    
 Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things.    
 So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Ear@@ th.    
 if you look at it a few billion years at a time.    
 So if you go back about two and a half billion years, the Earth was this bi@@ g, ster@@ i@@ le hun@@ k of ro@@ ck with a lot of chemic@@ als flo@@ ating around on it.    
 that the chemic@@ als got organ@@ iz@@ ed, we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.    
 And I think that there's theor@@ ies that are beginning to understand about how it started with R@@ N@@ A@@ , but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it, which is that, at that time, there were little dro@@ ps of o@@ il flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ p@@ es of chemic@@ als in them.    
 And some of those dro@@ ps of o@@ il had a particular comb@@ in@@ ation of chemic@@ als in them which ca@@ used them to in@@ cor@@ por@@ ate chemic@@ als from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of o@@ il.    
 And those were the most pri@@ mi@@ tive forms of cell@@ s in a sen@@ se, But now those dro@@ ps of o@@ il weren't really ali@@ ve, as we say it now, because every one of them was a little ran@@ dom reci@@ pe of chemic@@ als.    
 And every time it di@@ vide@@ d, they got sort of u@@ ne@@ qu@@ al di@@ vi@@ sion of the chemic@@ als within them.    
 And so every dro@@ p was a little bit differ@@ ent.    
 In fact, the dro@@ ps that were different in a way at in@@ cor@@ por@@ ating chemic@@ als around them, grew more and in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated more chemic@@ als and di@@ vid@@ ed more.    
 So those t@@ ended to live long@@ er, get ex@@ pres@@ sed more.    
 Now that's sort of just a very simple chemical form of life, but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a tri@@ ck about ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion.    
 Some@@ how by ways that we don't quite under@@ stan@@ d, these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information.    
 They learned to rec@@ ord the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DN@@ A@@ .    
 So in other words, they worked out, in this mind@@ less sort of evolu@@ tionary way, a form of writing that let them write down what they wer@@ e, The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have sta@@ yed ste@@ ad@@ y since it ev@@ ol@@ ved two and a half billion years ago.    
 In fact the reci@@ pe for us, our gen@@ es, is exactly that same code and that same way of writ@@ ing.    
 In fact, every living creatu@@ re is writ@@ ten in exactly the same set of let@@ ters and the same co@@ de.    
 In fact, one of the things that I did just for am@@ us@@ ement pur@@ pos@@ es is we can now write things in this co@@ de.    
 And I've got here a little 100 micro@@ gr@@ ams of white pow@@ d@@ er, which I try not to let the se@@ cur@@ ity people see at air@@ p@@ ort@@ s.    
   But this has in it -- the code has stand@@ ard let@@ ters that we use for sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ zing it -- and I wrote my business c@@ ard onto a piece of DN@@ A and am@@ p@@ li@@ fied it 10 to the 2@@ 2 times.    
 So if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business car@@ d, I have pl@@ ent@@ y for everyone in the room@@ , and, in fact, everyone in the world, and it's right here.    
   If I had really been a e@@ go@@ ti@@ st, I would have put it into a vir@@ us and rele@@ as@@ ed it in the room.    
   So what was the next st@@ ep@@ ?    
 W@@ r@@ iting down the DN@@ A was an interesting st@@ ep@@ .    
 And that ca@@ used these cell@@ s -- that k@@ ept them happy for another billion years.    
 But then there was another really interesting step which is these cell@@ s started ex@@ changing and communic@@ ating informa@@ tion, so that they began to get communities of cell@@ s.    
 I don't know if you know this, but bacteri@@ a can actually ex@@ change DN@@ A@@ .    
 Now that's wh@@ y, for instan@@ ce, an@@ ti@@ bio@@ tic re@@ si@@ stan@@ ce has ev@@ ol@@ v@@ ed.    
 Some bacteri@@ a figu@@ red out how to sta@@ y away from pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in, and it went around sort of creating its little DN@@ A information with other bacteri@@ a, and now we have a lot of bacteri@@ a that are re@@ sist@@ ant to pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in, because bacteri@@ a communic@@ ate.    
 Now what this communi@@ cation allow@@ ed was communities to form that, in some sen@@ se, were in the same bo@@ at together@@ ; they were syn@@ erg@@ is@@ tic.    
 So they survi@@ ved or they fail@@ ed together, which means that if a community was very success@@ ful, all the individu@@ als in that community were re@@ pe@@ ated more and they were fa@@ v@@ ore@@ d by evolu@@ tion.    
 Now the tran@@ si@@ tion point happened when these communities got so close that, in fact, they got together and decided to write down the whole reci@@ pe for the community together on one str@@ ing of DN@@ A@@ .    
 And so the next st@@ age that's interesting in life took about another billion years.    
 And at that st@@ age, we have multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ular communi@@ ties, communities of lots of different types of cell@@ s, working together as a single organ@@ ism.    
 And in fact, we're such a multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ular commun@@ ity.    
 We have lots of cell@@ s that are not out for themselves any@@ more.    
 Y@@ our sk@@ in cell is really us@@ el@@ ess without a heart c@@ ell, mus@@ cle c@@ ell, a brain cell and so on.    
 So these communities began to ev@@ ol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a c@@ ell, but a community which we call an organ@@ ism.    
 Now the next step that happened is within these communi@@ ties.    
 These communities of cell@@ s, again, began to ab@@ str@@ act information.    
 that did nothing but process information within the commun@@ ity.    
 And those are the ne@@ u@@ ral struc@@ ture@@ s.    
 So ne@@ ur@@ ons are the information process@@ ing app@@ ar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cell@@ s built up.    
 And in fact, they began to get speci@@ al@@ ists in the community and speci@@ al struc@@ tures that were respon@@ sible for rec@@ ord@@ ing, And that was the bra@@ ins and the ner@@ v@@ ous system of those communi@@ ties. And that gave them an evolu@@ tionary adv@@ an@@ ta@@ g@@ e.    
 Because at that poin@@ t, an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organ@@ ism, instead of over this evolu@@ tionary time sp@@ an.    
 So an organ@@ ism cou@@ l@@ d, for instan@@ ce, learn not to e@@ at a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sic@@ k last time it ate it.    
 That could happen within the life@@ time of a single organ@@ ism, wher@@ e@@ as before they@@ 'd built these speci@@ al information process@@ ing struc@@ tures, over hundreds of thousands of years by the individu@@ als d@@ ying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it.    
 So that ner@@ v@@ ous system@@ , the fact that they built these speci@@ al information struc@@ tures, trem@@ end@@ ously sp@@ ed up the whole process of evolu@@ tion.    
 Because evolution could now happen within an individu@@ al.    
 It could happen in learning time scal@@ es.    
 But then what happened of course, tric@@ ks of communic@@ at@@ ing.    
 And for example, the most s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated ver@@ sion that we're aw@@ are of is human langu@@ age.    
 It's really a pretty amazing inv@@ ention if you think about it.    
 Here I have a very complic@@ ated, m@@ ess@@ y, conf@@ used idea in my hea@@ d.    
 I'm sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting soun@@ ds bas@@ ic@@ ally, and hop@@ e@@ fully construc@@ ting a si@@ mil@@ ar m@@ ess@@ y, conf@@ used idea in your head that be@@ ars some an@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ y to it.    
 But we're taking something very complic@@ ated, tur@@ ning it into soun@@ d, sequ@@ ences of soun@@ ds, and produc@@ ing something very complicated in your bra@@ in.    
 So this allow@@ s us now as a single organ@@ ism.    
 And so, in fact, what we've done is w@@ e, human@@ ity, have started ab@@ str@@ ac@@ ting out.    
 We're going through the same level@@ s that multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ular organ@@ is@@ ms have gone through -- ab@@ str@@ ac@@ ting out our me@@ tho@@ ds of rec@@ ord@@ ing, present@@ ing, process@@ ing information.    
 So for example, the inv@@ ention of language was a tiny step in that direc@@ tion.    
 T@@ ele@@ ph@@ on@@ y, compu@@ ters, vide@@ o@@ ta@@ p@@ es, C@@ D@@ -@@ R@@ O@@ M@@ s and so on are all our speci@@ al@@ ized mechan@@ is@@ ms that we've now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information.    
 And it all connec@@ ts us together into something that is much bigg@@ er and much faster and able to ev@@ ol@@ ve than what we were before.    
 So now, evolution can take place on a scale of micro@@ secon@@ ds.    
 And you saw T@@ y's little evolu@@ tionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Con@@ volu@@ tion program right before your ey@@ es.    
 So now we've spe@@ ed@@ ed up the time scal@@ es once again.    
 So the first st@@ ep@@ s of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piec@@ e.    
 And the next st@@ ep@@ s, like ner@@ v@@ ous systems and bra@@ in@@ s, took a few hundred million years.    
 Then the next st@@ ep@@ s, like language and so on, took less than a million years.    
 And these next st@@ ep@@ s, like elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s, seem to be taking only a few deca@@ d@@ es.    
 The process is fe@@ e@@ ding on itself and be@@ com@@ ing, I gu@@ ess, au@@ to@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something re@@ infor@@ ces its r@@ ate of change.    
 The more it chang@@ es, the faster it chang@@ es.    
 And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explo@@ sion of cur@@ ve.    
 We're seeing this process fe@@ e@@ ding back on it@@ self.    
 Now I design compu@@ ters for a liv@@ ing, and I know that the mechan@@ is@@ ms that I use to design compu@@ ters would be impos@@ sible without recent adv@@ anc@@ es in compu@@ ters.    
 So right now, what I do is I design objec@@ ts at such comple@@ x@@ ity that it's really impos@@ sible for me to design them in the tra@@ di@@ tional sen@@ se.    
 I don't know what every tran@@ sist@@ or in the connec@@ tion machine do@@ es.    
 There are billi@@ ons of them.    
 Instea@@ d, what I do and what the desig@@ n@@ ers at Th@@ in@@ king M@@ ach@@ ines do is we think at some level of ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do, much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do.    
 And in fact, sometimes it takes it by me@@ tho@@ ds that we don't quite even under@@ stan@@ d.    
 One me@@ th@@ od that's particularly interesting is evolution it@@ self.    
 So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro@@ second time scal@@ e.    
 So for example, in the most ex@@ tre@@ me cas@@ es, we can actually ev@@ ol@@ ve a program by starting out with ran@@ dom sequ@@ ences of in@@ struc@@ tions.    
 S@@ a@@ y, "@@ C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter, would you please make a hundred million ran@@ dom sequ@@ ences of in@@ struc@@ tions.    
 Now would you please run all of those ran@@ dom sequ@@ ences of in@@ struc@@ tions, run all of those progr@@ am@@ s, and pick out the ones that came clo@@ s@@ est to doing what I wan@@ te@@ d@@ ."    
 So in other words, I def@@ ine what I wan@@ ted.    
 Let's say I want to sort numb@@ ers, as a simple example I've done it with@@ .    
 So find the progr@@ ams that come clo@@ s@@ est to sor@@ ting numb@@ ers.    
 So of course, ran@@ dom sequ@@ ences of in@@ struc@@ tions are very un@@ likely to sort numb@@ ers, so n@@ one of them will really do it.    
 But one of them, by l@@ uc@@ k, may put two numb@@ ers in the right ord@@ er.    
 And I say, "@@ C@@ om@@ pu@@ ter, of those ran@@ dom sequ@@ ences that did the best job@@ .    
 S@@ a@@ ve th@@ os@@ e. K@@ ill off the re@@ st.    
 And now let's re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numb@@ ers the b@@ es@@ t.    
 And let's re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ comb@@ in@@ ation an@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ ous to sex@@ ."    
 T@@ a@@ ke two progr@@ ams and they produce children by ex@@ changing their sub@@ rou@@ tin@@ es, and the children in@@ her@@ it the tra@@ its of the sub@@ rou@@ tin@@ es of the two progr@@ am@@ s.    
 So I've got now a new generation of progr@@ ams that are produc@@ ed by comb@@ in@@ ations of the progr@@ ams that did a little bit better job@@ .    
 S@@ a@@ y, "@@ P@@ le@@ ase re@@ pe@@ at that process@@ ."    
 S@@ cor@@ e them again.    
 In@@ tro@@ duce some mu@@ ta@@ tions perha@@ p@@ s.    
 And try that again and do that for another gener@@ ation.    
 Well every one of those gener@@ ations just takes a few milli@@ secon@@ ds.    
 of milli@@ ons of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minut@@ es, or in the complicated cas@@ es, in a few hour@@ s.    
 At the end of that, I end up with progr@@ ams that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numb@@ ers.    
 In fact, they are progr@@ ams that are much more eff@@ ici@@ ent than progr@@ ams I could have ever writ@@ ten by han@@ d.    
 Now if I look at those progr@@ am@@ s, I can't tell you how they work.    
 I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.    
 They're ob@@ sc@@ u@@ re, we@@ ird progr@@ am@@ s.    
 But they do the job@@ .    
 And in fact, I know, I'm very conf@@ id@@ ent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of progr@@ ams that did the job@@ .    
 In fact, their life dep@@ ended on doing the job@@ .    
   I was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 and he pul@@ ls out this c@@ ard and says, "O@@ h loo@@ k. L@@ oo@@ k at this.    
 It says, '@@ This plan@@ e has hundreds of thousands of tiny par@@ ts working together to make you a sa@@ fe f@@ light@@ .@@ ' Do@@ es@@ n't that make you feel conf@@ id@@ ent@@ ?"    
   In fact, we know that the engine@@ ering process doesn't work very well when it gets complic@@ ated.    
 So we're beginning to dep@@ end on compu@@ ters to do a process that's very different than engine@@ er@@ ing.    
 And it le@@ ts us produce things of much more comple@@ x@@ ity And ye@@ t, we don't quite understand the op@@ tions of it.    
 So in a sen@@ se, it's getting a@@ head of us.    
 We're now using those progr@@ ams to make much faster compu@@ ters so that we@@ 'll be able to run this process much fa@@ st@@ er.    
 So it's fe@@ e@@ ding back on it@@ self.    
 The thing is be@@ coming faster and that's why I think it seems so conf@@ us@@ ing.    
 Because all of these technologi@@ es are fe@@ e@@ ding back on them@@ selves.    
 We're taking off.    
 And what we are is we're at a point in time which is an@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ ous to when sing@@ le@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organ@@ is@@ ms were tur@@ ning into multi@@ -@@ cell@@ ed organ@@ is@@ m@@ s.    
 So we're the am@@ o@@ eb@@ as and we can't quite figure out what the hel@@ l this thing is we're cre@@ at@@ ing.    
 We're right at that point of tran@@ si@@ tion.    
 But I think that there really is something coming along after us.    
 to think that we're the end produc@@ t of evolu@@ tion.    
 And I think all of us here are a part of produc@@ ing what@@ ever that next thing is.    
 So l@@ unch is coming al@@ ong, and I think I will stop at that poin@@ t, before I get sel@@ ec@@ ted out.    
 I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medic@@ ine that has to change.    
 And I think it starts with one physic@@ i@@ an, and that's me.    
 And maybe I've been around long enough that I can aff@@ ord to give away some of my f@@ al@@ se pres@@ ti@@ ge to be able to do that.    
 Be@@ fore I actually begin the me@@ at of my tal@@ k, let's begin with a bit of bas@@ eb@@ all.    
 H@@ e@@ y, why no@@ t?    
 We're near the end, we're getting close to the World S@@ eri@@ es.    
 We all love bas@@ eb@@ all, don't we@@ ?    
   B@@ as@@ eb@@ all is f@@ ill@@ ed with some amazing sta@@ tis@@ tic@@ s.    
 And there's hundreds of them.    
 "@@ M@@ on@@ ey@@ b@@ all@@ " is about to come out, and it's all about sta@@ tis@@ tics and using sta@@ tis@@ tics to build a great bas@@ eb@@ all te@@ am.    
 I'm going to foc@@ us on one st@@ at that I hope a lot of you have heard of.    
 It's called bat@@ ting aver@@ age.    
 So we talk about a 3@@ 00@@ , a bat@@ ter who bat@@ s 3@@ 00@@ .    
 That means that b@@ all@@ play@@ er bat@@ ted sa@@ fel@@ y, hit sa@@ f@@ ely three times out of 10 at bat@@ s.    
 That means hit the b@@ all into the out@@ fiel@@ d, it dro@@ p@@ pe@@ d, it didn't get ca@@ u@@ ght, and who@@ ever tried to th@@ row it to first bas@@ e didn't get there in time and the run@@ ner was sa@@ f@@ e.    
 Th@@ ree times out of 10@@ .    
 Do you know what they call a 3@@ 00 h@@ it@@ ter in Ma@@ j@@ or Le@@ ag@@ ue B@@ as@@ eb@@ all@@ ?    
 Goo@@ d, really goo@@ d, maybe an all@@ -@@ star@@ .    
 Do you know what they call a 4@@ 00 bas@@ eb@@ all h@@ it@@ ter@@ ?    
 That's somebody who h@@ it, by the way, four times sa@@ f@@ ely out of every 10@@ .    
 Le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary -- as in T@@ ed W@@ illi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary -- the last Ma@@ j@@ or Le@@ ag@@ ue B@@ as@@ eb@@ all play@@ er to hit over 4@@ 00 during a re@@ gu@@ lar se@@ as@@ on.    
 Now let's take this back into my world of medic@@ ine where I'm a lot more comfor@@ table, or perhaps a bit less comfor@@ table after what I'm going to talk to you ab@@ out.    
 Su@@ pp@@ ose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s and you're ref@@ er@@ red to a sur@@ ge@@ on who's bat@@ ting 4@@ 00 on app@@ en@@ dec@@ tom@@ ies.    
   Some@@ how this isn't working out, is it?    
 Now supp@@ ose you live in a certain part of a certain re@@ mo@@ te place and you have a loved one who has bloc@@ k@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family doctor ref@@ ers that loved one to a car@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist But, bu@@ t, you know what@@ ? S@@ he's doing a lot better this year. S@@ he's on the com@@ e@@ back tra@@ il.    
 And she's h@@ it@@ ting a 2@@ 5@@ 7@@ .    
 Some@@ how this isn't work@@ ing.    
 But I'm going to ask you a ques@@ tion.    
 What do you think a bat@@ ting average for a car@@ di@@ a@@ c sur@@ ge@@ on or a n@@ ur@@ se prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c sur@@ ge@@ on, is supposed to be@@ ?    
 1@@ ,00@@ 0, very goo@@ d.    
 Now truth of the matter is, no@@ body knows in all of medic@@ ine what a good sur@@ ge@@ on or physic@@ ian or par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is supposed to bat@@ .    
 What we do though is we s@@ end each one of them, including my@@ self, with the ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tion, be perfec@@ t.    
 N@@ ever ever@@ , ever make a mista@@ ke, but you wor@@ ry about the deta@@ il@@ s, about how that's going to happen@@ .    
 And that was the messa@@ ge that I ab@@ sor@@ bed when I was in med school.    
 I was an ob@@ ses@@ sive comp@@ ul@@ sive stud@@ ent.    
 In high school, a clas@@ sm@@ ate once said that B@@ ri@@ an G@@ old@@ man would study for a blood tes@@ t.    
   And so I di@@ d.    
 And I stu@@ died in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the n@@ ur@@ ses@@ ' resid@@ ence at T@@ or@@ onto G@@ en@@ er@@ al H@@ osp@@ it@@ al, not far from here.    
 And I memor@@ ized every@@ thing.    
 I memor@@ ized in my anatom@@ y class the or@@ ig@@ ins and ex@@ er@@ tions of every mus@@ c@@ le, every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ ter@@ y that came off the a@@ or@@ ta@@ , differ@@ ential di@@ ag@@ no@@ ses ob@@ sc@@ ure and com@@ mon@@ .    
 I even knew the differ@@ ential di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis in how to clas@@ si@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ lar ac@@ id@@ os@@ is.    
 And all the whi@@ le, I was ama@@ s@@ sing more and more knowle@@ dg@@ e.    
 And I did well, I gradu@@ ated with hon@@ or@@ s, And I came out of medi@@ cal school that if I memor@@ ized everything and knew every@@ thing, or as much as possib@@ le, as close to everything as possib@@ le, that it would im@@ m@@ un@@ ize me against making mista@@ k@@ es.    
 And it worked for a whi@@ le, until I met M@@ r@@ s. D@@ r@@ uck@@ er.    
 I was a resid@@ ent at a teach@@ ing hosp@@ ital here in T@@ or@@ onto when M@@ r@@ s. D@@ r@@ uck@@ er was brought to the emerg@@ ency de@@ partment of the hosp@@ ital where I was work@@ ing.    
 At the time I was assig@@ ned to the car@@ di@@ o@@ logy ser@@ vice on a car@@ di@@ o@@ logy ro@@ ta@@ tion.    
 And it was my job@@ , when the emerg@@ ency st@@ af@@ f called for a car@@ di@@ o@@ logy con@@ sul@@ t, to see that pati@@ ent in emerg@@ .    
 and to repor@@ t back to my att@@ end@@ ing.    
 And I saw M@@ r@@ s. D@@ r@@ uck@@ er, and she was brea@@ th@@ l@@ ess.    
 And when I list@@ ened to her, she was making a whe@@ e@@ z@@ y soun@@ d.    
 And when I list@@ ened to her ch@@ est with a ste@@ th@@ os@@ cop@@ e, I could hear crac@@ k@@ ly soun@@ ds on both sid@@ es that told me that she was in con@@ g@@ es@@ tive heart fail@@ u@@ re.    
 This is a condi@@ tion in which the heart fail@@ s, and instead of being able to pu@@ m@@ p all the blood for@@ war@@ d, some of the blood bac@@ ks up into the l@@ un@@ g, the l@@ un@@ g@@ s f@@ ill up with bloo@@ d, and that's why you have sh@@ ort@@ ness of brea@@ th.    
 And that wasn't a difficult di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis to ma@@ k@@ e.    
 I made it and I set to work tre@@ ating her@@ .    
 I gave her as@@ p@@ ir@@ in. I gave her medi@@ cations to reli@@ eve the stra@@ in on her hear@@ t.    
 I gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tic@@ s, water p@@ ill@@ s, And over the course of the next hour and a half or tw@@ o, she started to feel better.    
 And I felt really goo@@ d.    
 And that's when I made my first mista@@ ke@@ ; I sent her hom@@ e.    
 A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally, I made two more mista@@ k@@ es.    
 I sent her home without spea@@ king to my att@@ end@@ ing.    
 I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do, which was call my att@@ ending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for hi@@ m@@ self. And he knew her, he would have been able to f@@ ur@@ n@@ ish ad@@ di@@ tional information about her@@ .    
 Maybe I did it for a good reas@@ on.    
 Maybe I didn't want to be a high@@ -@@ main@@ ten@@ ance resid@@ ent.    
 Maybe I wanted to be so success@@ ful and so able to take respon@@ sib@@ ility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my att@@ end@@ ing@@ 's pati@@ ents without even having to cont@@ act him.    
 The second mista@@ ke that I made was wor@@ se.    
 In sen@@ ding her hom@@ e, I dis@@ re@@ gar@@ ded a little vo@@ ice de@@ ep down inside that was trying to tell me, "@@ G@@ old@@ man, not a good idea@@ . D@@ on@@ 't do this@@ ."    
 In fact, so l@@ ac@@ king in conf@@ idence was I that I actually asked the n@@ ur@@ se who was looking after M@@ r@@ s. D@@ r@@ uck@@ er, "@@ Do you think it's oka@@ y if she goes home@@ ?"    
 And the n@@ ur@@ se thought about it and said very mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ t@@ ly, "@@ Yea@@ h, I think she@@ 'll do oka@@ y."    
 I can remember that like it was y@@ es@@ ter@@ day.    
 So I sig@@ ned the dis@@ char@@ ge pa@@ per@@ s, and an am@@ bul@@ ance ca@@ me, par@@ am@@ e@@ dic@@ s came to take her hom@@ e.    
 And I went back to my work on the war@@ ds.    
 All the rest of that day, that af@@ ter@@ no@@ on, I had this kind of g@@ na@@ w@@ ing feeling inside my st@@ om@@ ach@@ .    
 But I car@@ ried on with my work.    
 And at the end of the day, I pac@@ ked up to leave the hosp@@ ital and walked to the par@@ king lot to take my car and dri@@ ve home when I did something that I don't usually do.    
 I walked through the emerg@@ ency de@@ partment on my way hom@@ e.    
 And it was there that another n@@ ur@@ se, not the n@@ ur@@ se who was looking after M@@ r@@ s. D@@ r@@ uck@@ er before@@ , but another n@@ ur@@ se, said three words to me that are the three words that most emerg@@ ency physic@@ i@@ ans I know d@@ rea@@ d.    
 O@@ ther@@ s in medic@@ ine d@@ read them as well, but there's something particular about emerg@@ ency medic@@ ine because we see pati@@ ents so f@@ le@@ et@@ ing@@ ly.    
 The three words are@@ : Do you rememb@@ er@@ ?    
 "@@ Do you remember that pati@@ ent you sent home@@ ?"    
 the other n@@ ur@@ se asked mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ t@@ ly.    
 "@@ Well she's back@@ ," in just that t@@ one of voic@@ e.    
 Well she was back all right.    
 She was back and near dea@@ th.    
 A@@ b@@ out an hour after she had arri@@ ved hom@@ e, after I'd sent her hom@@ e, she col@@ la@@ p@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 1@@ 1 and the par@@ am@@ e@@ dic@@ s brought her back to the emerg@@ ency de@@ partment where she had a blood pres@@ sure of 5@@ 0, which is in sever@@ e sh@@ oc@@ k.    
 And she was b@@ are@@ ly brea@@ thing and she was bl@@ u@@ e.    
 And the emerg@@ . st@@ af@@ f pul@@ led out all the stop@@ s.    
 They gave her medi@@ cations to ra@@ ise her blood pres@@ su@@ re.    
 They put her on a v@@ enti@@ lat@@ or.    
 And I was sh@@ oc@@ ked and sha@@ ken to the co@@ re.    
 And I went through this ro@@ ll@@ er co@@ ast@@ er, because after they st@@ ab@@ ili@@ zed her, she went to the in@@ ten@@ sive care un@@ it, and I hop@@ ed against hope that she would re@@ cover@@ .    
 And over the next two or three days, it was cle@@ ar that she was never going to wa@@ ke up.    
 She had ir@@ re@@ ver@@ sible brain da@@ mag@@ e.    
 And the family ga@@ ther@@ ed.    
 And over the course of the next eight or nine days, they re@@ sig@@ ned themselves to what was happen@@ ing.    
 And at about the nine day mar@@ k, they let her go -- M@@ r@@ s. D@@ r@@ uck@@ er, a wi@@ f@@ e, a mother and a grand@@ mother@@ .    
 They say you never for@@ get the nam@@ es of those who di@@ e.    
 And that was my first time to be ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with that.    
 O@@ ver the next few wee@@ ks, I be@@ at myself up and I experienc@@ ed for the first time the un@@ health@@ y sha@@ me that exist@@ s in our culture of medic@@ ine -- where I felt al@@ one, is@@ ol@@ ated, not feeling the health@@ y kind of sha@@ me that you feel@@ , because you can't talk about it with your colleag@@ u@@ es.    
 You know that health@@ y kin@@ d, when you bet@@ ra@@ y a secre@@ t that a best friend made you prom@@ ise never to re@@ ve@@ al and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend conf@@ ron@@ ts you and you have terri@@ ble disc@@ us@@ sion@@ s, but at the end of it all that sic@@ k feeling gu@@ id@@ es you and you say, I'll never make that mista@@ ke again.    
 And you make am@@ ends and you never make that mista@@ ke again.    
 That's the kind of sha@@ me that is a te@@ ac@@ her@@ .    
 The un@@ health@@ y sha@@ me I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sic@@ k insid@@ e.    
 It's the one that says, not that what you did was ba@@ d, but that you are ba@@ d.    
 And it was what I was feel@@ ing.    
 And it wasn't because of my att@@ end@@ ing@@ ; he was a dol@@ l@@ .    
 He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he s@@ mo@@ o@@ th@@ ed things over and made sure that I didn't get su@@ ed.    
 And I k@@ ept asking myself these ques@@ tions.    
 Why didn't I ask my att@@ end@@ ing? Why did I s@@ end her home@@ ?    
 And then at my worst mom@@ ent@@ s: Why did I make such a stu@@ pi@@ d mista@@ ke@@ ?    
 Why did I go into medic@@ ine@@ ?    
 S@@ low@@ ly but su@@ re@@ ly, it lif@@ ted.    
 I began to feel a bit better.    
 And on a cl@@ ou@@ dy day, there was a crac@@ k in the cl@@ ou@@ ds and the su@@ n started to come out and I wonder@@ ed, maybe I could feel better again.    
 And I made myself a bar@@ ga@@ in that if only I re@@ d@@ ou@@ ble my eff@@ or@@ ts to be perfect and never make another mista@@ ke again, please make the voic@@ es stop@@ .    
 And they di@@ d.    
 And I went back to work.    
 And then it happened again.    
 Tw@@ o years later I was an att@@ ending in the emerg@@ ency de@@ partment at a community hosp@@ ital just nor@@ th of T@@ or@@ on@@ to, and I saw a 2@@ 5 year-@@ old man with a sor@@ e th@@ ro@@ at.    
 It was bus@@ y, I was in a bit of a h@@ ur@@ r@@ y.    
 He k@@ ept poin@@ ting here.    
 I looked at his th@@ ro@@ at, it was a little bit p@@ in@@ k.    
 And I gave him a pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion for pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and sent him on his way.    
 And even as he was walking out the do@@ or, he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his th@@ ro@@ at.    
 And two days later I came to do my next emerg@@ ency shi@@ f@@ t, and that's when my chi@@ ef asked to speak to me qui@@ et@@ ly in her offic@@ e.    
 And she said the three wor@@ d@@ s: Do you rememb@@ er@@ ?    
 "@@ Do you remember that pati@@ ent you saw with the sor@@ e th@@ ro@@ at@@ ?"    
 Well it turns out, he didn't have a stre@@ p th@@ ro@@ at.    
 He had a pot@@ entially life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening condi@@ tion called ep@@ ig@@ lo@@ t@@ ti@@ ti@@ s. You can Goog@@ le it, but it's an in@@ fec@@ tion, not of the th@@ ro@@ at, but of the u@@ pp@@ er air@@ way, and it can actually cause the air@@ way to clo@@ se.    
 And fortun@@ ately he didn't di@@ e.    
 He was plac@@ ed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous an@@ ti@@ bio@@ tics and he re@@ cover@@ ed after a few day@@ s.    
 And I went through the same peri@@ od of sha@@ me and rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.    
 Tw@@ ice in one emerg@@ ency shi@@ f@@ t, I mis@@ sed app@@ en@@ di@@ citi@@ s.    
 Now that takes some do@@ ing, especially when you work in a hosp@@ ital that at the time saw but 1@@ 4 people a ni@@ ght.    
 Now in both cas@@ es, I didn't s@@ end them home and I don't think there was any ga@@ p in their ca@@ re.    
 One I thought had a kid@@ ney st@@ one.    
 I ord@@ ered a kid@@ ney X@@ -@@ ra@@ y. When it turned out to be normal@@ , my colleag@@ ue who was doing a reas@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of the pati@@ ent no@@ tic@@ ed some t@@ end@@ er@@ ness in the right low@@ er qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ant and called the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ s.    
 The other one had a lot of di@@ ar@@ r@@ hea@@ .    
 I ord@@ ered some flu@@ id@@ s to re@@ hy@@ d@@ r@@ ate him and asked my colleag@@ ue to reas@@ s@@ ess him.    
 And he did and when he no@@ tic@@ ed some t@@ end@@ er@@ ness in the right low@@ er qu@@ ad@@ ran@@ t, called the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ s.    
 In both cas@@ es, they had their oper@@ ations and they did oka@@ y.    
 But each time, they were g@@ na@@ w@@ ing at me, e@@ ating at me.    
 And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mista@@ kes only happened in the first five years of prac@@ tice as many of my colleag@@ u@@ es say, which is to@@ tal B@@ .@@ S.    
   Some of my do@@ o@@ z@@ ies have been in the last five years.    
 Al@@ one, as@@ ha@@ med and un@@ supp@@ or@@ ted.    
 Here's the problem@@ : If I can't come clean and talk about my mista@@ k@@ es, if I can't find the sti@@ ll@@ -@@ small vo@@ ice that tel@@ ls me what really happen@@ ed, how can I share it with my colleag@@ u@@ es?    
 How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing@@ ?    
 If I were to walk into a room -- like right now, I have no idea what you think of me.    
 When was the last time you heard somebody talk about fail@@ ure after fail@@ ure after fail@@ u@@ re@@ ?    
 O@@ h yea@@ h, you go to a co@@ c@@ k@@ ta@@ il par@@ ty and you might hear about some other doc@@ tor@@ , but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mista@@ k@@ es.    
 If I were to walk into a room f@@ ill@@ ed with my colleag@@ es and ask for their supp@@ ort right now and start to tell what I've just told you right now, I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfor@@ table, somebody would crac@@ k a jo@@ ke, they@@ 'd change the subjec@@ t and we would move on.    
 And in fact, if I knew and my colleag@@ u@@ es knew that one of my or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c colleag@@ u@@ es took off the wrong le@@ g in my hosp@@ it@@ al, believe me, I'd have tr@@ ou@@ ble making ey@@ e cont@@ act with that pers@@ on.    
 That's the system that we ha@@ ve.    
 It's a comple@@ te den@@ ial of mista@@ k@@ es.    
 It's a system in which there are two kinds of physic@@ i@@ ans -- those who make mista@@ kes and those who don@@ '@@ t, those who can't hand@@ le sle@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation and those who can@@ , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ com@@ es.    
 And it's almost like an ide@@ o@@ logical reac@@ tion, like the an@@ ti@@ bodies begin to att@@ ack that pers@@ on.    
 And we have this idea that if we dri@@ ve the people who make mista@@ kes out of medic@@ ine, what will we be left with@@ , but a sa@@ fe system.    
 But there are two problems with that.    
 of medi@@ cal bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ sting and jour@@ nal@@ ism, I've made a person@@ al study of medi@@ cal mal@@ prac@@ tice and medi@@ cal er@@ r@@ ors to learn everything I can@@ , from one of the first ar@@ tic@@ les I wrote for the T@@ or@@ onto S@@ ta@@ r to my show "@@ Wh@@ ite Co@@ at, B@@ l@@ ack Ar@@ t@@ ."    
 And what I've learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous.    
 We work in a system where er@@ r@@ ors happen every day, where one in 10 medi@@ cations are ei@@ ther the wrong medi@@ cation given in hosp@@ ital or at the wrong d@@ os@@ age, where hosp@@ it@@ al@@ -@@ ac@@ qui@@ red in@@ fec@@ tions are getting more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous, ca@@ using ha@@ vo@@ c and dea@@ th.    
 In this countr@@ y, as many as 2@@ 4@@ ,000 C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ ans di@@ e of pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able medi@@ cal er@@ ror@@ s.    
 In the United St@@ ates, the In@@ stitu@@ te of M@@ e@@ dic@@ ine pe@@ gg@@ ed it at 1@@ 00@@ ,00@@ 0@@ .    
 In both cas@@ es, these are g@@ ross under@@ es@@ tim@@ ates, because we really aren't fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we sh@@ oul@@ d.    
 And here's the thing.    
 In a hosp@@ ital system where medi@@ cal knowledge is d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ing every two or three years, we can't keep up with it.    
 S@@ le@@ ep de@@ pri@@ v@@ ation is absolutely per@@ v@@ as@@ i@@ ve.    
 We can't get ri@@ d of it.    
 We have our cog@@ ni@@ tive bi@@ as@@ es, so that I can take a perfect history on a pati@@ ent with ch@@ est pa@@ in.    
 Now take the same pati@@ ent with ch@@ est pa@@ in, make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ rul@@ ous and put a little bit of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l on their brea@@ th, and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with contemp@@ t.    
 I don't take the same hi@@ story.    
 I'm not a robo@@ t@@ ; I don't do things the same way each time.    
 And my pati@@ ents aren't car@@ s@@ ; they don't tell me their sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s in the same way each time.    
 G@@ i@@ ven all of that, mista@@ kes are in@@ ev@@ it@@ able.    
 So if you take the system@@ , as I was ta@@ u@@ ght, and we@@ ed out all the er@@ ror@@ -@@ p@@ r@@ one health prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als, well there won@@ 't be anybody lef@@ t.    
 And you know that business about people not wan@@ ting to talk about their worst cas@@ es?    
 On my sh@@ ow, on "@@ Wh@@ ite Co@@ at, B@@ l@@ ack Ar@@ t@@ ," I made it a ha@@ bit of say@@ ing, "@@ Here's my worst mista@@ ke@@ ," I would say to everybody from par@@ am@@ e@@ dic@@ s to the chi@@ ef of car@@ di@@ a@@ c surg@@ er@@ y, "@@ Here's my worst mista@@ ke@@ ," b@@ la@@ h, b@@ la@@ h, b@@ la@@ h, b@@ la@@ h, b@@ la@@ h, "What about your@@ s@@ ?" and I would point the micro@@ phone towards them.    
 And their pu@@ p@@ ils would di@@ lat@@ e, they would re@@ co@@ il, then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stor@@ ies.    
 They want to tell their stor@@ ies. They want to share their stor@@ ies.    
 They want to be able to say, "@@ L@@ oo@@ k, don't make the same mista@@ ke I di@@ d@@ ."    
 What they need is an environment to be able to do that.    
 What they need is a re@@ defin@@ ed medi@@ cal cul@@ ture.    
 And it starts with one physic@@ ian at a time.    
 The re@@ defin@@ ed physic@@ ian is human@@ , knows she's human@@ , acc@@ ep@@ ts it, isn't p@@ rou@@ d of making mista@@ k@@ es, but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody el@@ se.    
 She sha@@ res her experience with other@@ s.    
 S@@ he's supp@@ or@@ tive when other people talk about their mista@@ k@@ es.    
 And she poin@@ ts out other people@@ 's mista@@ k@@ es, not in a go@@ t@@ ch@@ a way, but in a lo@@ v@@ ing, supp@@ or@@ tive way so that everybody can bene@@ f@@ it.    
 And she wor@@ ks in a culture of medic@@ ine that ac@@ knowle@@ dg@@ es that human be@@ ings run the system@@ , and when human be@@ ings run the system@@ , they will make mista@@ kes from time to time.    
 So the system is ev@@ ol@@ ving to create back@@ up@@ s that make it eas@@ i@@ er to de@@ te@@ ct those mista@@ kes that human@@ s in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably make and also f@@ o@@ st@@ ers in a lo@@ v@@ ing, supp@@ or@@ tive way places where everybody who is ob@@ ser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mista@@ kes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mista@@ k@@ es, we're re@@ war@@ ded for coming cle@@ an.    
 My name is B@@ ri@@ an G@@ old@@ man@@ .    
 I am a re@@ defin@@ ed physic@@ i@@ an.    
 I'm human@@ . I make mista@@ k@@ es.    
 I'm sor@@ ry about that, but I stri@@ ve to learn one thing that I can pas@@ s on to other people.    
 I still don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.    
 And let me close with three words of my ow@@ n@@ : I do rememb@@ er.    
 Do you know how many choices you make in a typical da@@ y?    
 Do you know how many choices you make in typical wee@@ k@@ ?    
 I rec@@ ently did a sur@@ v@@ ey with over 2@@ ,000 Americ@@ an@@ s, and the average number of choices that the typical American repor@@ ts making is about 7@@ 0 in a typical day.    
 There was also rec@@ ently a study done with C@@ E@@ O@@ s in which they follow@@ ed C@@ E@@ O@@ s around for a whole wee@@ k.    
 And these scientists simply do@@ cu@@ mented all the vari@@ ous t@@ as@@ ks that these C@@ E@@ O@@ s eng@@ ag@@ ed in and how much time they spent eng@@ ag@@ ing in making decisions rel@@ ated to these t@@ as@@ ks.    
 And they found that the average C@@ E@@ O eng@@ ag@@ ed in about 1@@ 3@@ 9 t@@ as@@ ks in a wee@@ k.    
 E@@ ach t@@ ask was made up of man@@ y, man@@ y, many sub@@ -@@ choices of cour@@ se.    
 50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minut@@ es or l@@ ess.    
 O@@ n@@ ly about 1@@ 2 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time.    
 Th@@ ink about your own choic@@ es.    
 Do you know how many choices make it into your nine min@@ u@@ te categor@@ y ver@@ su@@ s your one hour categor@@ y?    
 How well do you think you're doing at manag@@ ing those choic@@ es?    
 To@@ day I want to talk about one of the biggest moder@@ n day choos@@ ing problems that we ha@@ ve, which is the choice over@@ lo@@ ad problem.    
 I want to talk about the problem and some potential solu@@ tions.    
 Now as I talk about this proble@@ m, I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answ@@ ers.    
 So when I ask you a ques@@ tion, since I'm bl@@ in@@ d, only ra@@ ise your hand if you want to bur@@ n off some cal@@ ori@@ es.    
   O@@ ther@@ wis@@ e, when I ask you a ques@@ tion, and if your answer is y@@ es, I'd like you to cla@@ p your han@@ ds.    
 So for my first question for you to@@ day@@ : Are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ lo@@ ad problem@@ ?    
   Thank you.    
 So when I was a gradu@@ ate stud@@ ent at St@@ an@@ for@@ d U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity, I used to go to this very, very up@@ scale g@@ ro@@ cer@@ y store@@ ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scal@@ e.    
 It was a store called D@@ ra@@ eg@@ er@@ '@@ s.    
 Now this store@@ , it was almost like going to an am@@ us@@ ement par@@ k.    
 They had 2@@ 50 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ its and ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les and more than two do@@ z@@ en different kinds of bo@@ tt@@ led water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to d@@ rin@@ k ta@@ p water.    
 I used to love going to this store@@ , but on one oc@@ ca@@ sion I asked my@@ self, well how come you never buy any@@ thing@@ ?    
 Here's their o@@ live o@@ il a@@ is@@ le.    
 including those that were in a loc@@ ked case that came from thous@@ an@@ d-@@ year-@@ old o@@ live tre@@ es.    
 So I one day decided to pa@@ y a vis@@ it to the manag@@ er, and I asked the manag@@ er, "@@ Is this model of offer@@ ing people all this choice really work@@ ing@@ ?"    
 And he poin@@ ted to the bus@@ lo@@ ad@@ s of tou@@ ri@@ sts that would show up every@@ day, with camer@@ as ready usu@@ ally.    
 We decided to do a little experi@@ ment, and we pic@@ ked j@@ am for our experi@@ ment.    
 Here's their j@@ am a@@ is@@ le.    
 They had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of j@@ am.    
 We set up a little ta@@ sting boo@@ th right near the ent@@ ran@@ ce of the store@@ .    
 We there put out six different fla@@ v@@ ors of j@@ am or 2@@ 4 different fla@@ v@@ ors of j@@ am, and we looked at two thing@@ s: Fir@@ st, in which case were people more likely to stop@@ , sam@@ ple some j@@ am@@ ?    
 M@@ or@@ e people stopped when there were 2@@ 4@@ , about 6@@ 0 perc@@ ent, than when there were si@@ x, about 40 perc@@ ent.    
 The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am.    
 Now we see the op@@ pos@@ ite effec@@ t.    
 O@@ f the people who stopped when there were 2@@ 4@@ , only three percent of them actually b@@ ought a j@@ ar of j@@ am.    
 O@@ f the people who stopped when there were si@@ x, well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually b@@ ought a j@@ ar of j@@ am.    
 Now if you do the ma@@ th, people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am if they en@@ coun@@ tered six than if they en@@ coun@@ tered 2@@ 4@@ .    
 Now choos@@ ing not to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am is probably good for us -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ lo@@ ad problem affec@@ ts us even in very consequ@@ ential deci@@ sion@@ s.    
 We choose not to choos@@ e, even when it goes against our best self-@@ interes@@ ts.    
 So now for the top@@ ic of to@@ day@@ : fin@@ anci@@ al sa@@ v@@ ings.    
 Now I'm going to descri@@ be to you a study I did with G@@ ur H@@ u@@ ber@@ man, E@@ m@@ ir K@@ am@@ en@@ i@@ ca, We@@ i J@@ an@@ g where we looked at the re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment sa@@ v@@ ings decisions of nearly a million Americ@@ ans from about 6@@ 50 plan@@ s all in the U.S.    
 And what we looked at was whether the number of fu@@ nd offer@@ ings avail@@ able in a re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment sa@@ v@@ ings plan@@ , the 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan@@ , does that affec@@ t people@@ 's like@@ li@@ hood to save more for tom@@ or@@ row@@ .    
 And what we found was that in@@ de@@ ed there was a cor@@ rela@@ tion.    
 So in these plan@@ s, we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plan@@ s that ran@@ ged from offer@@ ing people any@@ where from two to 5@@ 9 different fu@@ nd offer@@ ings.    
 And what we found was that, the more fun@@ ds offer@@ ed, in@@ de@@ ed, there was less partici@@ pa@@ tion r@@ ate.    
 So if you look at the ex@@ trem@@ es, those plan@@ s that offer@@ ed you two fund@@ s, partici@@ pa@@ tion r@@ ates were around in the m@@ id@@ -@@ 7@@ 0@@ s -- still not as high as we want it to be.    
 In those plan@@ s that offer@@ ed nearly 6@@ 0 fund@@ s, partici@@ pa@@ tion r@@ ates have now dro@@ pped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th perc@@ enti@@ le.    
 Now it turns out that even if you do choose to partici@@ p@@ ate when there are more choices pres@@ ent, even then, it has nega@@ tive consequ@@ enc@@ es.    
 So for those people who did choose to partici@@ pat@@ e, the more choices avail@@ able, the more likely people were to completely a@@ vo@@ id st@@ oc@@ ks or equ@@ ity fund@@ s.    
 The more choices avail@@ able, the more likely they were to put all their money in pu@@ re money marke@@ t ac@@ coun@@ ts.    
 Now nei@@ ther of these ex@@ tre@@ me decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ comm@@ end for people when you're consid@@ ering their future fin@@ anci@@ al well@@ -@@ be@@ ing.    
 Well, over the past deca@@ de, to offer@@ ing people more and more choic@@ es.    
 They're more likely to del@@ a@@ y choos@@ ing -- proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interes@@ t.    
 They're more likely to make worse choices -- worse fin@@ anci@@ al choic@@ es, medi@@ cal choic@@ es.    
 They're more likely to choose things that make them less satis@@ fi@@ ed, even when they do objec@@ tively better.    
 The main reason for this is be@@ cause, we might en@@ jo@@ y ga@@ zing at those gi@@ ant w@@ all@@ s of ma@@ y@@ on@@ na@@ is@@ es, mu@@ star@@ ds, v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s, j@@ am@@ s, but we can't actually do the mat@@ h of com@@ par@@ ing and con@@ tra@@ sting and actually pic@@ king from that st@@ un@@ ning disp@@ la@@ y.    
 So what I want to pro@@ p@@ ose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tes@@ ted in one way or another in different research ven@@ u@@ es -- that you can eas@@ ily app@@ ly in your busin@@ ess@@ es.    
 The fir@@ st@@ : C@@ u@@ t.    
 You@@ 've heard it said before@@ , but it's never been more tru@@ e than today, that less is more.    
 People are always up@@ set when I say, "@@ C@@ ut@@ ."    
 They're always wor@@ ried they're going to lo@@ se sh@@ el@@ f spac@@ e.    
 But in fact, what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cu@@ t, get ri@@ d of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous re@@ d@@ und@@ ant op@@ tions, well there's an increase in sal@@ es, there's a low@@ ering of co@@ sts, there is an impro@@ v@@ ement of the choos@@ ing experienc@@ e.    
 When P@@ ro@@ c@@ tor & G@@ am@@ ble went from 2@@ 6 different kinds of H@@ ea@@ d & Sh@@ oul@@ d@@ ers to 1@@ 5@@ , they saw an increase in sal@@ es by 10 perc@@ ent.    
 got ri@@ d of their 10 wor@@ st@@ -@@ sel@@ ling c@@ at lit@@ ter produc@@ ts, they saw an increase in prof@@ its by 8@@ 7 percent -- a fun@@ c@@ tion of both increase in sal@@ es and low@@ ering of co@@ st@@ s.    
 You know, the average g@@ ro@@ cer@@ y store today offer@@ s you 4@@ 5@@ ,000 produc@@ ts.    
 The typical W@@ al@@ mar@@ t today offer@@ s you 1@@ 00@@ ,000 produc@@ ts.    
 But the n@@ in@@ th larg@@ est re@@ ta@@ il@@ er, the n@@ in@@ th biggest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er in the world today is Al@@ di@@ , and it offer@@ s you only 1@@ ,@@ 4@@ 00 produc@@ ts -- one kind of can@@ ned tom@@ a@@ to sa@@ uc@@ e.    
 Now in the fin@@ anci@@ al sa@@ v@@ ings world, I think one of the best exam@@ ples that has rec@@ ently come out on how to best man@@ age the choice offer@@ ings has actually been something that D@@ a@@ vi@@ d L@@ ai@@ b@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly invol@@ ved in desig@@ ning, which was the program that they have at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d.    
 Every single H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ e is now au@@ tom@@ a@@ tically en@@ ro@@ l@@ led in a lif@@ ec@@ y@@ cle fun@@ d.    
 For those people who actually want to choos@@ e, they're given 20 fund@@ s, not 3@@ 00 or more fund@@ s.    
 You know, of@@ t@@ en, people say, "I don't know how to cu@@ t.    
 They're all important choic@@ es@@ ."    
 And the first thing I do is I ask the emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es, "@@ T@@ ell me how these choices are different from one an@@ other.    
 And if your emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es can't tell them a@@ par@@ t, nei@@ ther can your con@@ su@@ mer@@ s."    
 Now before we started our ses@@ sion this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on, I had a ch@@ at with G@@ ary.    
 to offer people in this audi@@ ence an all@@ -@@ exp@@ en@@ ses@@ -@@ pa@@ id free va@@ cation to the most beautiful road in the world.    
 Here's a descri@@ p@@ tion of the roa@@ d.    
 And I'd like you to read it.    
 And now I'll give you a few secon@@ ds to read it if you're ready to take G@@ ary up on his offer@@ .    
   Oka@@ y. An@@ y@@ body who's ready to take him up on his offer@@ .    
 Is that all@@ ?    
 All right, let me show you some more about this.    
   You guys knew there was a tric@@ k, didn't you.    
   Now who's ready to go on this tri@@ p.    
     I think I might have actually heard more han@@ ds.    
 All right.    
 Now in fact, you had objec@@ tively more information the first time around than the second time aroun@@ d, but I would ven@@ ture to gu@@ ess that you felt that it was more real the second time aroun@@ d.    
 Because the pictures made it feel more real to you.    
 Wh@@ ich br@@ ings me to the second techniqu@@ e for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ lo@@ ad proble@@ m, which is concre@@ ti@@ z@@ ation.    
 the differ@@ ences between the choic@@ es, they have to be able to understand the consequ@@ ences as@@ soci@@ ated with each choic@@ e, and that the consequ@@ ences need to be felt in a vi@@ vi@@ d sort of way, in a very concre@@ te way.    
 Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an A@@ T@@ M c@@ ard or a cre@@ di@@ t c@@ ard as op@@ pos@@ ed to ca@@ sh@@ ?    
 Because it doesn't feel like real mone@@ y.    
 And it turns out that making it feel more concre@@ te can actually be a very posi@@ tive tool to use in getting people to save more.    
 So a study that I did with Sh@@ l@@ om@@ o B@@ en@@ ar@@ t@@ z@@ i and Al@@ ess@@ an@@ d@@ r@@ o P@@ re@@ v@@ it@@ er@@ o, we did a study with people at I@@ N@@ G -- emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es that are all working at I@@ N@@ G -- and now these people were all in a ses@@ sion where they're doing en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment for their 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan@@ .    
 And during that ses@@ sion, we k@@ ept the ses@@ sion exactly the way it used to be, but we ad@@ ded one little thing.    
 The one little thing we ad@@ ded was we asked people to just think about all the posi@@ tive things that would happen in your life if you sa@@ ved more.    
 By doing that simple thing, there was an increase in en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sa@@ v@@ ings ac@@ coun@@ t by four perc@@ ent.    
 The third techniqu@@ e: C@@ at@@ eg@@ or@@ iz@@ ation.    
 We can hand@@ le more categor@@ ies than we can hand@@ le choic@@ es.    
 So for example, here's a study we did in a mag@@ az@@ ine a@@ is@@ le.    
 It turns out that in We@@ g@@ man@@ s g@@ ro@@ cer@@ y store@@ s up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or, the mag@@ az@@ ine a@@ is@@ les ran@@ ge any@@ where from 3@@ 3@@ 1 different kinds of mag@@ az@@ ines all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4@@ .    
 But you know what@@ ?    
 If I show you 6@@ 00 mag@@ az@@ ines and I di@@ vid@@ e them up into 10 categ@@ ori@@ es, ver@@ su@@ s I show you 4@@ 00 mag@@ az@@ ines and di@@ vid@@ e them up into 20 categ@@ ori@@ es, you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choos@@ ing experience if I gave you the 4@@ 00 Because the categor@@ ies tell me how to tell them a@@ par@@ t.    
 Here are two different je@@ w@@ el@@ ry disp@@ lay@@ s.    
 One is called "@@ J@@ az@@ z@@ " and the other one is called "@@ S@@ w@@ ing@@ ."    
 If you think the disp@@ la@@ y on the left is S@@ w@@ ing and the disp@@ la@@ y on the right is J@@ az@@ z@@ , cla@@ p your han@@ ds.    
   Oka@@ y, there's som@@ e.    
 If you think the one on the left is J@@ az@@ z and the one on the right is S@@ w@@ ing, cla@@ p your han@@ ds.    
 Oka@@ y, a bit more.    
 Now it turns out you're right.    
 The one on the left is J@@ az@@ z and the one on the right is S@@ w@@ ing, but you know what@@ ?    
 This is a high@@ ly us@@ el@@ ess categor@@ iz@@ ation sch@@ em@@ e.    
   The categor@@ ies need to say something to the choos@@ er, not the choic@@ e-@@ ma@@ k@@ er.    
 And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fund@@ s.    
 Who are they actually supposed to be infor@@ m@@ ing?    
 My four@@ th techniqu@@ e: Con@@ di@@ tion for comple@@ x@@ ity.    
 It turns out we can actually hand@@ le a lot more information than we think we can@@ , we've just got to take it a little eas@@ i@@ er.    
 We have to gradu@@ ally increase the comple@@ x@@ ity.    
 I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking ab@@ out.    
 Let's take a very, very complicated deci@@ sion@@ : bu@@ ying a car@@ .    
 Here's a Ger@@ man car man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ re@@ r that gi@@ ves you the opportunity to completely cu@@ st@@ om make your car@@ .    
 You@@ 've got to make 6@@ 0 different deci@@ sion@@ s, completely make up your car@@ .    
 Now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they offer per deci@@ sion.    
 C@@ ar color@@ s, ex@@ teri@@ or car col@@ ors -- I've got 5@@ 6 choic@@ es.    
 Eng@@ in@@ es, ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ ft -- four choic@@ es.    
 So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appe@@ ar@@ .    
 So half of the cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are going to go from high choic@@ e, 5@@ 6 car color@@ s, The other half of the cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers are going to go from low choic@@ e, four ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ f@@ ts, to 5@@ 6 car color@@ s, high choic@@ e.    
 What am I going to look at@@ ?    
 How eng@@ ag@@ ed you are.    
 If you keep h@@ it@@ ting the de@@ fa@@ ult bu@@ tt@@ on per deci@@ sion, that means you're getting over@@ wh@@ el@@ me@@ d, that means I'm lo@@ sing you.    
 What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choic@@ e, they're h@@ it@@ ting that de@@ fa@@ ult bu@@ tt@@ on over and over and over again.    
 We're lo@@ sing them.    
 They go from low choice to high choic@@ e, they're han@@ g@@ ing in there.    
 It's the same information. It's the same number of choic@@ es.    
 is I have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is present@@ ed.    
 If I start you off eas@@ y, I learn how to choos@@ e.    
 E@@ ven though choos@@ ing ge@@ ar@@ shi@@ ft doesn't tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ i@@ or de@@ cor@@ , it still pre@@ pa@@ res me for how to choos@@ e.    
 It also gets me exc@@ ited about this big produc@@ t that I'm putting together, so I'm more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be en@@ ga@@ ge@@ d.    
 So let me re@@ cap@@ .    
 I have talked about four techniques for mi@@ ti@@ g@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ lo@@ ad -- c@@ ut -- get ri@@ d of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alter@@ na@@ tiv@@ es@@ ; concre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real@@ ; categor@@ ize -- we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ori@@ es, less choic@@ es@@ ; condi@@ tion for comple@@ x@@ ity.    
 All of these techniques that I'm descri@@ bing to you today are desig@@ ned to help you man@@ age your choices -- better for you, you can use them on your@@ self, better for the people that you are ser@@ v@@ ing.    
 to getting the most from choice is to be choos@@ y about choos@@ ing.    
 And the more we're able to be choos@@ y about choos@@ ing the better we will be able to prac@@ tice the art of choos@@ ing.    
 Thank you very much.    
 In the 19@@ 80@@ s in the commun@@ ist E@@ a@@ ster@@ n Ger@@ man@@ y, if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er, you had to re@@ gi@@ ster it with the govern@@ ment.    
 You had to re@@ gi@@ ster a sam@@ ple she@@ et of t@@ ext out of the ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ er.    
 And this was done so the government could tr@@ ack where t@@ ext was coming from@@ .    
 If they found a pa@@ per which had the wrong kind of thought, they could tr@@ ack down who created that thou@@ ght.    
 And we in the W@@ est couldn't understand how anybody could do this, how much this would re@@ stri@@ ct freedom of spe@@ e@@ ch.    
 We would never do that in our own countri@@ es.    
 But today in 20@@ 1@@ 1, if you go and buy a color las@@ er prin@@ ter from any maj@@ or las@@ er prin@@ ter man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ re@@ r and prin@@ t a p@@ age, that p@@ age will end up having s@@ light y@@ el@@ low do@@ ts prin@@ ted on every single p@@ age in a patter@@ n which makes the p@@ age unique to you and to your p@@ r@@ inter@@ .    
 This is happen@@ ing to us today.    
 And no@@ body seems to be making a f@@ us@@ s about it.    
 And this is an example of the ways that our own govern@@ ments are using technology against us, the citi@@ zen@@ s.    
 And this is one of the main three sour@@ ces of online problems today.    
 If we take a look at what's really happen@@ ing in the online world, we can group the att@@ ac@@ ks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers.    
 We have three main grou@@ p@@ s.    
 We have online cri@@ min@@ als.    
 Li@@ ke here, we have M@@ r. D@@ im@@ it@@ ry G@@ olu@@ bo@@ v from the city of K@@ i@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine.    
 And the motiv@@ es of online cri@@ min@@ als are very easy to under@@ stan@@ d.    
 These guys make mone@@ y.    
 They use online att@@ ac@@ ks to make lots of mone@@ y, and lots and lots of it.    
 We actually have several ca@@ ses of milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res on@@ lin@@ e, mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ ai@@ re@@ s, who made money with their att@@ ac@@ ks.    
 Here's V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir T@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in form T@@ ar@@ t@@ u in E@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ a.    
 This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z@@ .    
 This is Ste@@ ph@@ en W@@ at@@ t.    
 This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ und@@ in.    
 This is M@@ at@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ s@@ on, T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on.    
 These guys make their fortun@@ es on@@ lin@@ e, but they make it through the il@@ leg@@ al means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king, or with ke@@ y@@ log@@ g@@ ers to colle@@ ct our cre@@ di@@ t c@@ ard information while we are doing online shop@@ ping from an in@@ fec@@ ted compu@@ ter.    
 The U.S. S@@ ec@@ re@@ t S@@ er@@ vic@@ e, two months ago, f@@ ro@@ ze the S@@ wis@@ s b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t of M@@ r. S@@ am J@@ ain right here, and that b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t had 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was f@@ ro@@ z@@ en.    
 M@@ r. J@@ ain hi@@ m@@ self is on the loo@@ se@@ ; no@@ body knows where he is.    
 And I cla@@ i@@ m it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become the vic@@ ti@@ m of a cri@@ me online than here in the real world.    
 And it's very obvi@@ ous that this is only going to get wor@@ se.    
 In the fu@@ ture, the maj@@ or@@ ity of cri@@ me will be happen@@ ing on@@ lin@@ e.    
 The second maj@@ or group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by mone@@ y.    
 They're motiv@@ ated by something else -- motiv@@ ated by pro@@ tes@@ ts, motiv@@ ated by an opini@@ on, motiv@@ ated by the la@@ ugh@@ s.    
 G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous have ris@@ en up over the last 1@@ 2 months and have become a maj@@ or play@@ er in the fiel@@ d of online att@@ ac@@ ks.    
 So those are the three main att@@ ack@@ er@@ s: cri@@ min@@ als who do it for the mone@@ y, doing it for the pro@@ tes@@ t, but then the last group are n@@ ation st@@ ates, govern@@ ments doing the att@@ ac@@ ks.    
 And then we look at ca@@ ses like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ No@@ tar@@ .    
 This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when govern@@ ments att@@ ack against their own citi@@ zen@@ s.    
 Di@@ gi@@ No@@ ta@@ r is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate A@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ ity from The N@@ e@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds -- or actu@@ ally, it was@@ .    
 It was run@@ ning into ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ c@@ y last f@@ all because they were ha@@ c@@ ked in@@ to.    
 Some@@ body bro@@ ke in and they ha@@ c@@ ked it th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly.    
 And I asked last week in a me@@ e@@ ting with D@@ ut@@ ch government represent@@ a@@ tiv@@ es, I asked one of the lead@@ ers of the team whether he found pla@@ usi@@ ble that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ No@@ ta@@ r ha@@ c@@ k.    
 And his answer was y@@ es.    
 as the result of a ha@@ ck like this?    
 Well Di@@ gi@@ No@@ ta@@ r is a C@@ .@@ A@@ .    
 They sel@@ l cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ at@@ es.    
 What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ at@@ es?    
 if you have a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite that has h@@ tt@@ ps, S@@ S@@ L enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted servic@@ es, services like G@@ ma@@ il.    
 Now we all, or a big part of us, use G@@ ma@@ il or one of their compe@@ ti@@ tor@@ s, but these services are especially pop@@ ular in to@@ tal@@ it@@ ari@@ an st@@ ates like I@@ ran@@ , where dis@@ sid@@ ents use fore@@ ign services like G@@ ma@@ il because they know they are more trustworth@@ y than the local services and they are enc@@ r@@ yp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connec@@ tions, so the local government can't s@@ no@@ op on their disc@@ us@@ sion@@ s.    
 E@@ x@@ cep@@ t they can if they ha@@ ck into a fore@@ ign C@@ .@@ A@@ .    
 and issu@@ e ro@@ gu@@ e cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ at@@ es.    
 And this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ No@@ tar@@ .    
 What about A@@ ra@@ b S@@ p@@ r@@ ing and things that have been happen@@ ing, for example, in Egyp@@ t?    
 Well in Egyp@@ t, the ri@@ o@@ ters loo@@ ted the head@@ quar@@ ters of the Egyp@@ ti@@ an secre@@ t poli@@ ce in A@@ pri@@ l 20@@ 1@@ 1, and when they were loo@@ ting the building they found lots of pa@@ per@@ s.    
 A@@ mon@@ g those pa@@ per@@ s, was this b@@ in@@ der enti@@ t@@ led "@@ F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R@@ ."    
 And within that b@@ in@@ der were no@@ tes from a company based in Ger@@ many which had so@@ ld the Egyp@@ ti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communi@@ cation of the citi@@ zens of the countr@@ y.    
 They had so@@ ld this tool for 2@@ 80@@ ,000 E@@ uro@@ s to the Egyp@@ ti@@ an govern@@ ment.    
 The company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here.    
 So W@@ es@@ ter@@ n govern@@ ments are provid@@ ing to@@ tal@@ it@@ ari@@ an govern@@ ments with tools to do this against their own citi@@ zen@@ s.    
 But W@@ es@@ ter@@ n govern@@ ments are doing it to themselves as well.    
 For example, in Ger@@ man@@ y, just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was foun@@ d, which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by Ger@@ man government offic@@ i@@ als to inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ate their own citi@@ zen@@ s.    
 If you are a s@@ us@@ pect in a cri@@ min@@ al case, well it's pretty obvi@@ ous, your phone will be ta@@ p@@ pe@@ d.    
 But today, it goes beyond that.    
 They will ta@@ p your Inter@@ net connec@@ tion.    
 They will even use tools like St@@ ate T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to in@@ fec@@ t your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an, which en@@ ab@@ les them to watch all your communi@@ cation, to list@@ en to your online disc@@ us@@ sion@@ s, to colle@@ ct your pas@@ s@@ wor@@ ds.    
 Now when we think deep@@ er about things like thes@@ e, the obvi@@ ous respon@@ se from people should be that, "O@@ ka@@ y, that soun@@ ds ba@@ d, but that doesn't really affec@@ t me because I'm a leg@@ al citi@@ z@@ en.    
 Why should I wor@@ r@@ y?    
 Because I have nothing to h@@ ide@@ ."    
 And this is an argu@@ ment, which doesn't make sen@@ se.    
 P@@ ri@@ v@@ ac@@ y is imp@@ li@@ ed.    
 P@@ ri@@ v@@ ac@@ y is not up for disc@@ us@@ sion.    
 This is not a question between pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y against se@@ cur@@ ity.    
 It's a question of freedom against contro@@ l@@ .    
 And while we might trust our govern@@ ments right now, right here in 20@@ 1@@ 1, any right we give away will be given away for goo@@ d.    
 any future govern@@ ment, a government we might have 50 years from now@@ ?    
 And these are the questions that we have to wor@@ ry about for the next 50 years.    
 This is where I liv@@ e. I live in Ken@@ y@@ a, at the s@@ outh par@@ ts of the Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i Na@@ tional Par@@ k.    
 Th@@ ose are my da@@ d@@ 's c@@ ow@@ s at the back, and behind the c@@ ow@@ s, that's the Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i Na@@ tional Par@@ k.    
 Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i Na@@ tional Par@@ k is not f@@ enc@@ ed in the s@@ outh w@@ id@@ ely, which means w@@ il@@ d anim@@ als like z@@ e@@ br@@ as mi@@ gr@@ ate out of the par@@ k fre@@ el@@ y.    
 So pre@@ dat@@ ors like li@@ ons follow them, and this is what they do.    
 They kill our liv@@ es@@ to@@ c@@ k.    
 This is one of the c@@ ow@@ s which was killed at night, and I just w@@ o@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning and I found it dea@@ d, and I felt so ba@@ d, because it was the only bul@@ l we ha@@ d.    
 My commun@@ ity, the Ma@@ as@@ ai@@ , we believe that we came from hea@@ ven with all our anim@@ als and all the land for her@@ ding them, and that's why we value them so much.    
 So I grew up h@@ ating li@@ ons so much.    
 The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who prote@@ ct our community and the liv@@ es@@ to@@ c@@ k, and they're also up@@ set about this problem.    
 So they kill the li@@ on@@ s.    
 It's one of the six li@@ ons which were killed in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi@@ .    
 And I think this is why the Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i Na@@ tional Par@@ k li@@ ons are fe@@ w@@ .    
 So a bo@@ y, from six to nine years old, in my community is respon@@ sible for his da@@ d@@ 's c@@ ow@@ s, and that's the same thing which happened to me.    
 So I had to find a way of sol@@ ving this problem.    
 And the first idea I got was to use fi@@ re, because I thought li@@ ons were s@@ ca@@ red of fi@@ re.    
 But I came to realize that that didn't really hel@@ p, because it was even hel@@ ping the li@@ ons to see through the c@@ ow@@ sh@@ ed.    
 So I didn't give up. I contin@@ u@@ ed.    
 And a second idea I got was to use a s@@ ca@@ rec@@ row@@ .    
 I was trying to tri@@ ck the li@@ ons [@@ into thin@@ k@@ ing@@ ] that I was standing near the c@@ ow@@ sh@@ ed.    
 But li@@ ons are very cle@@ ver. They will come the first day and they see the s@@ ca@@ rec@@ row@@ , and they go back, but the second day, they@@ 'll come and they say, this thing is not moving here, it's always here. So he ju@@ mp@@ s in and kill@@ s the anim@@ als.    
 So one night, I was walking around the c@@ ow@@ sh@@ ed with a tor@@ ch, and that day, the li@@ ons didn't com@@ e.    
 And I discover@@ ed that li@@ ons are afraid of a moving li@@ ght.    
 So I had an idea@@ .    
 S@@ in@@ ce I was a small bo@@ y, I used to work in my room for the whole day, and I even took a@@ part my mom@@ 's new radi@@ o, and that day she almost killed me, but I learned a lot about elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s. So I got an old car bat@@ ter@@ y, an indi@@ cat@@ or bo@@ x@@ . It's a small de@@ vice found in a mo@@ tor@@ cy@@ c@@ le, and it hel@@ ps mo@@ tor@@ ists when they want to turn right or lef@@ t. It bl@@ in@@ ks.    
 And I got a s@@ wit@@ ch where I can s@@ wit@@ ch on the light@@ s, on and off.    
 And that's a small tor@@ ch from a bro@@ ken fl@@ ash@@ li@@ ght.    
 So I set up every@@ thing.    
 As you can see, the sol@@ ar pan@@ el char@@ g@@ es the bat@@ ter@@ y, and the bat@@ ter@@ y supp@@ li@@ es the power to the small indi@@ cat@@ or bo@@ x@@ . I call it a trans@@ for@@ mer@@ .    
 And the indi@@ cat@@ or bo@@ x makes the li@@ ghts fl@@ ash@@ .    
 As you can see, the bul@@ b@@ s face out@@ sid@@ e, because that's where the li@@ ons come from@@ .    
 And that's how it looks to li@@ ons when they come at ni@@ ght.    
 The li@@ ghts fl@@ as@@ h and tri@@ ck the li@@ ons into thinking I was walking around the c@@ ow@@ sh@@ ed, but I was sle@@ ep@@ ing in my be@@ d.    
     Th@@ an@@ ks.    
 So I set it up in my home two years ago, and since then, we have never experienc@@ ed any problem with li@@ on@@ s.    
 And my neighbor@@ ing hom@@ es heard about this idea@@ .    
 One of them was this grand@@ mother@@ .    
 She had a lot of her anim@@ als being killed by li@@ on@@ s, and she asked me if I could put the li@@ ghts for her@@ .    
 And I said, "@@ Y@@ es@@ ."    
 So I put the light@@ s. You can see at the back, those are the li@@ on light@@ s.    
 S@@ in@@ ce now, I've set up seven hom@@ es around my commun@@ ity, and they're really work@@ ing.    
 And my idea is also being used now all over Ken@@ y@@ a for sc@@ aring other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as, le@@ op@@ ar@@ ds, and it's also being used to sc@@ are ele@@ ph@@ an@@ ts away from people@@ 's far@@ m@@ s.    
 Because of this inv@@ en@@ tion, I was luck@@ y to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best school@@ s in Ken@@ y@@ a, B@@ roo@@ k@@ house Inter@@ national S@@ chool@@ , and I'm really exc@@ ited about this.    
 My new school now is coming in and hel@@ ping by fund@@ rais@@ ing and creating an a@@ wa@@ ren@@ ess.    
 I even took my friends back to my commun@@ ity, and we're in@@ st@@ all@@ ing the li@@ ghts to the hom@@ es which don't have [@@ any@@ ]@@ , and I'm teach@@ ing them how to put them.    
 So one year ago, I was just a boy in the sa@@ v@@ an@@ n@@ a gr@@ as@@ s@@ land her@@ ding my father@@ 's c@@ ow@@ s, and I used to see plan@@ es fl@@ ying over@@ , and I told myself that one day, I'll be there insid@@ e.    
 And here I am today.    
 I got a chance to come by plan@@ e for my first time for TED@@ .    
 So my big dream is to become an air@@ cra@@ ft engine@@ er and pi@@ lot when I grow up.    
 I used to h@@ ate li@@ on@@ s, but now because my inv@@ ention is sa@@ ving my father@@ 's c@@ ow@@ s and the li@@ on@@ s, we are able to sta@@ y with the li@@ ons without any conf@@ lic@@ t.    
 A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n. It means in my langu@@ age, th@@ ank you very much.    
   Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son@@ : You have no idea how exc@@ iting it is to hear a story like your@@ s.    
 So you got this sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p@@ .@@ Ri@@ ch@@ ard T@@ ur@@ er@@ e: Y@@ ep@@ .    
 CA: You're working on other elec@@ tri@@ cal inv@@ en@@ tions.    
 What's the next one on your list@@ ?    
 R@@ T@@ : My next inv@@ ention is, I want to make an elec@@ tri@@ c f@@ enc@@ e@@ .@@ CA: E@@ lec@@ tri@@ c f@@ enc@@ e?    
 R@@ T@@ : But I know elec@@ tri@@ c f@@ ences are already invent@@ ed, but I want to make min@@ e.    
   CA: You already tried it on@@ ce, right, and you -@@ -@@ R@@ T@@ : I tried it before@@ , but I stopped because it gave me a sh@@ oc@@ k. CA: In the t@@ ren@@ ch@@ es. Ri@@ ch@@ ard T@@ ur@@ er@@ e, you are something el@@ se.    
 We're going to che@@ er you on every step of the way, my fri@@ en@@ d.    
 Thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .@@ R@@ T@@ : Thank you.     
 When I was litt@@ le, I thought my country was the best on the planet.    
 And I grew up sing@@ ing a s@@ ong called "@@ No@@ thing To En@@ v@@ y."    
 And I was very p@@ rou@@ d.    
 In school, we spent a lot of time stud@@ ying the history of K@@ i@@ m I@@ l@@ -@@ S@@ un@@ g, but we never learned much about the outside world, excep@@ t that Ameri@@ ca, South K@@ o@@ rea@@ , J@@ ap@@ an are the en@@ em@@ ies.    
 Al@@ though I often wonder@@ ed about the outside world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North K@@ o@@ rea@@ , until everything suddenly chan@@ ge@@ d.    
 When I was seven years old, I saw my first public ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tion.    
 But I thought my life in North Kore@@ a was normal@@ .    
 My family was not po@@ or, and my@@ self, I had never experienc@@ ed hun@@ g@@ er.    
 But one day, in 19@@ 9@@ 5@@ , my mo@@ m brought home a let@@ ter from a co@@ work@@ er@@ 's sist@@ er.    
 It rea@@ d, "@@ When you read this, our five family memb@@ ers will not ex@@ ist in this world, because we haven't e@@ at@@ en for the past three wee@@ ks.    
 We are l@@ ying on the flo@@ or together, and our bodies are so wea@@ k, we are wa@@ iting to di@@ e."    
 I was so sh@@ oc@@ ke@@ d.    
 This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffer@@ ing.    
 S@@ o@@ on af@@ ter, when I was walking past a tra@@ in sta@@ tion, I saw something terri@@ ble that to this day I can't er@@ ase from my memor@@ y.    
 A lif@@ el@@ ess woman was l@@ ying on the grou@@ n@@ d, while an em@@ ac@@ i@@ ated child in her ar@@ ms just st@@ ared hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly at his mother@@ 's fac@@ e.    
 But no@@ body helped them, because they were so foc@@ used on taking care of themselves and their famili@@ es.    
 A huge fam@@ ine hit North Kore@@ a in the m@@ id@@ -@@ 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s.    
 U@@ l@@ tim@@ ately, more than a million North Kore@@ ans died during the fam@@ ine, and many only survi@@ ved by e@@ ating gr@@ as@@ s, bu@@ g@@ s and t@@ ree bar@@ k.    
 P@@ ow@@ er ou@@ ta@@ g@@ es also became more and more fre@@ qu@@ ent, so everything around me was completely dar@@ k at night, excep@@ t for the se@@ a of li@@ ghts in Chin@@ a, just across the ri@@ ver from my hom@@ e.    
 I always wonder@@ ed why they had light@@ s, but we di@@ d@@ n'@@ t.    
 This is a s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite picture showing North Kore@@ a at night, comp@@ ared to neighbor@@ s.    
 This is the A@@ m@@ no@@ k Ri@@ ver, which ser@@ ves as a part of the b@@ order between North Kore@@ a and Chin@@ a.    
 As you can see, the ri@@ ver can be very nar@@ row at certain poin@@ ts, allow@@ ing North Kore@@ ans to secre@@ tly c@@ ro@@ s@@ s.    
 But many di@@ e.    
 Some@@ times, I saw de@@ ad bodies flo@@ ating down the ri@@ ver.    
 I can't re@@ ve@@ al many deta@@ ils about how I left North K@@ o@@ rea@@ , but I only can say that during the u@@ g@@ ly years of the fam@@ ine, I was sent to Chin@@ a to live with dist@@ ant rela@@ tiv@@ es.    
 But I only thought that I would be se@@ par@@ ated from my family for a short time.    
 I could have never imagin@@ ed that it would take 1@@ 4 years to live together.    
 In Chin@@ a, it was hard living as a young girl without my famil@@ y.    
 I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Kore@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e.    
 But I soon learned it's not only ex@@ trem@@ ely diffic@@ ul@@ t, it's also very danger@@ ous, since North Kore@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es are consid@@ ered in Chin@@ a as il@@ leg@@ al mi@@ gran@@ ts.    
 So I was living in con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ar that my identity could be re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed, and I would be re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated to a hor@@ ri@@ ble f@@ at@@ e, back in North K@@ o@@ rea@@ .    
 One day, my worst ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are came tru@@ e, when I was caught by the Chinese polic@@ e, and brought to the poli@@ ce st@@ ation for inter@@ ro@@ ga@@ tion.    
 Some@@ one had acc@@ used me of being North Kore@@ an, so they tes@@ ted my Chinese language ab@@ ili@@ ties, and asked me tons of ques@@ tions.    
 I was so s@@ care@@ d.    
 I thought my heart was going to explo@@ de.    
 If anything seemed un@@ n@@ atur@@ al, I could be imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ed and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated.    
 I thought my life was over@@ .    
 But I manag@@ ed to control all the emo@@ tions inside me, and answer the ques@@ tions.    
 Af@@ ter they fin@@ ish@@ ed ques@@ tion@@ ing me, one offic@@ ial said to an@@ other@@ , "@@ This was a f@@ al@@ se repor@@ t. S@@ he's not North Kore@@ an@@ ."    
 And they let me go. It was a mirac@@ le.    
 Some North Kore@@ ans in Chin@@ a see@@ k as@@ y@@ l@@ um in fore@@ ign em@@ bas@@ si@@ es.    
 But many can be caught by the Chinese polic@@ e, and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated.    
 These girls were so luck@@ y.    
 E@@ ven though they were ca@@ u@@ ght, they were even@@ tu@@ ally rele@@ as@@ ed, after hea@@ v@@ y inter@@ national pres@@ su@@ re.    
 These North Kore@@ ans were not so luck@@ y.    
 Every year, coun@@ t@@ less North Kore@@ ans are caught in Chin@@ a and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated to North K@@ o@@ rea@@ , where they can be tor@@ ture@@ d, imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ed, or pub@@ lic@@ ly ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ted.    
 E@@ ven though I was really fortun@@ ate to get out, many other North Kore@@ ans have not been so luck@@ y.    
 It's tra@@ gic that North Kore@@ ans have to h@@ ide their identi@@ ties and stru@@ gg@@ le so hard just to survi@@ ve.    
 E@@ ven after learning a new language and getting a job@@ , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an instan@@ t.    
 That's wh@@ y, after 10 years of h@@ id@@ ing my identi@@ ty, I decided to ris@@ k going to South K@@ o@@ rea@@ .    
 And I started a new life yet again.    
 S@@ et@@ t@@ ling down in South Kore@@ a was a lot more challeng@@ ing than I had expec@@ ted.    
 Eng@@ lish was so important in South K@@ o@@ rea@@ , so I had to start learning my third langu@@ age.    
 Al@@ so, I realized there was a w@@ ide ga@@ p between North and S@@ ou@@ th.    
 We are all Kore@@ an, but insid@@ e, we have become very differ@@ ent, du@@ e to 6@@ 7 years of di@@ vi@@ sion.    
 I even went through an identity cri@@ si@@ s.    
 A@@ m I South Kore@@ an or North Kore@@ an@@ ?    
 Wh@@ ere am I from@@ ? Who am I@@ ?    
 Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly, there was no country I could p@@ rou@@ d@@ ly call my ow@@ n.    
 E@@ ven though ad@@ ju@@ sting to life in South Kore@@ a was not eas@@ y, I made a pl@@ an -- I started stud@@ ying for the uni@@ versity ent@@ ran@@ ce exam@@ .    
 Just as I was starting to get used to my new life, I recei@@ ved a sh@@ oc@@ king phone call@@ .    
 The North Kore@@ an au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties inter@@ cep@@ ted some money that I sent to my family, and, as a p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment, my family was going to be for@@ ci@@ b@@ ly re@@ moved to a des@@ ol@@ ate lo@@ cation in the countr@@ y@@ sid@@ e.    
 They had to get out quick@@ ly.    
 So I started plan@@ ning how to help them es@@ cap@@ e.    
 North Kore@@ ans have to tra@@ vel incredi@@ ble di@@ stan@@ ces on the pat@@ h to fre@@ ed@@ om@@ .    
 It's almost impos@@ sible to c@@ ross the b@@ order So, ir@@ on@@ ic@@ ally, I took a f@@ light back to Chin@@ a and head@@ ed tow@@ ard the North Kore@@ an b@@ ord@@ er.    
 S@@ in@@ ce my family couldn't speak Chin@@ es@@ e, I had to gu@@ ide them some@@ how through more than 2@@ ,000 miles in Chin@@ a, and then into S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a.    
 The jour@@ ney by bu@@ s took one wee@@ k, and we were almost caught several times.    
 One time, our bu@@ s was stopped and bo@@ ar@@ ded by a Chinese poli@@ ce offic@@ er.    
 He took every@@ one's I@@ .@@ D@@ . car@@ ds, and he started asking them ques@@ tions.    
 S@@ in@@ ce my family couldn't understand Chin@@ es@@ e, I thought my family was going to be ar@@ re@@ st@@ ed.    
 As the Chinese offic@@ er approach@@ ed my family, I imp@@ ul@@ si@@ vel@@ y st@@ ood up, and I told him that these are dea@@ f and du@@ m@@ b people that I was cha@@ per@@ on@@ ing.    
 He looked at me s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ ous@@ ly, but luck@@ il@@ y, he believ@@ ed me.    
 We made it all the way to the b@@ order of L@@ a@@ o@@ s.    
 But I had to spend almost all my money to bri@@ be the b@@ order gu@@ ar@@ ds in L@@ a@@ o@@ s.    
 But even after we got past the b@@ ord@@ er, my family was ar@@ re@@ sted and j@@ a@@ il@@ ed for il@@ leg@@ al b@@ order c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ ing.    
 Af@@ ter I pa@@ id the f@@ ine and bri@@ be, my family was rele@@ as@@ ed in one mon@@ th.    
 But soon af@@ ter, my family was ar@@ re@@ sted and j@@ a@@ il@@ ed again, in the cap@@ ital of L@@ a@@ o@@ s.    
 This was one of the low@@ est poin@@ ts in my life.    
 I did everything to get my family to fre@@ ed@@ om@@ , and we came so clo@@ se, but my family was th@@ row@@ n in j@@ a@@ il, just a short di@@ stan@@ ce from the South Kore@@ an em@@ bas@@ s@@ y.    
 I went back and for@@ th between the im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tion off@@ ice and the poli@@ ce sta@@ tion, des@@ per@@ ately trying to get my family out.    
 but I didn't have enough money to pa@@ y a bri@@ be or f@@ ine any@@ more.    
 I lo@@ st all hop@@ e.    
 At that mom@@ ent, I heard one man@@ 's vo@@ ice ask me, "@@ What's wr@@ ong@@ ?"    
 I was so surpri@@ sed that a to@@ tal strang@@ er ca@@ red enough to as@@ k.    
 In my bro@@ ken Eng@@ li@@ sh@@ , and with a dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ y, I expla@@ ined the situ@@ ation, and without h@@ es@@ it@@ at@@ ing, the man went to the A@@ T@@ M@@ , and he pa@@ id the rest of the money for my family, I th@@ an@@ ked him with all my hear@@ t, and I asked him, "@@ Why are you hel@@ ping me@@ ?"    
 "I'm not hel@@ ping you@@ ," he said@@ .    
 "I'm hel@@ ping the North Kore@@ an people@@ ."    
 I realized that this was a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c moment in my life.    
 The kind strang@@ er sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ zed new hope for me and the North Kore@@ an people, when we needed it mo@@ st.    
 And he show@@ ed me that the kin@@ d@@ ness of strang@@ ers and the supp@@ ort of the inter@@ national community are truly the ra@@ ys of hope we North Kore@@ an people ne@@ ed.    
 E@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally, after our long jour@@ ne@@ y, my family and I were re@@ un@@ ited in South K@@ o@@ rea@@ .    
 But getting to freedom is only half the b@@ att@@ le.    
 M@@ any North Kore@@ ans are se@@ par@@ ated from their famili@@ es, and when they arri@@ ve in a new countr@@ y, they start with little or no mone@@ y.    
 So we can bene@@ fit from the inter@@ national community for edu@@ cation, Eng@@ lish language tra@@ in@@ ing, job tra@@ in@@ ing, and more.    
 We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Kore@@ a and the outside world.    
 Because many of us sta@@ y in cont@@ act with family memb@@ ers still insid@@ e, and we s@@ end information and money that is hel@@ ping to change North Kore@@ a from insid@@ e.    
 I've been so luck@@ y, recei@@ ved so much help and inspi@@ ra@@ tion in my life, so I want to help give as@@ p@@ ir@@ ing North Kore@@ ans a chance to pro@@ sp@@ er with inter@@ national supp@@ or@@ t.    
 I'm conf@@ id@@ ent that you will see more and more North Kore@@ ans succ@@ e@@ e@@ ding all over the world, including the TED st@@ age.    
 Thank you.    
 I live in South C@@ ent@@ r@@ al.    
 This is South C@@ ent@@ r@@ al@@ : li@@ qu@@ or store@@ s, fast food, v@@ ac@@ ant lo@@ ts.    
 So the city plan@@ n@@ ers, they get together and they figure they're going to change the name South C@@ ent@@ ral to make it re@@ present something el@@ se, so they change it to South L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es, like this is going to fi@@ x what's really going wrong in the city.    
 This is South L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es. Li@@ qu@@ or store@@ s, fast food, v@@ ac@@ ant lo@@ ts.    
 Just like 2@@ 6@@ .@@ 5 million other Americ@@ an@@ s, I live in a food deser@@ t, South C@@ ent@@ ral L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es, home of the dri@@ ve@@ -@@ th@@ r@@ u and the dri@@ ve@@ -@@ b@@ y.    
 F@@ un@@ ny thing is, the dri@@ ve@@ -@@ th@@ r@@ us are kill@@ ing more people than the dri@@ ve@@ -@@ by@@ s.    
 People are d@@ ying from cur@@ able diseas@@ es in South C@@ ent@@ ral L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es.    
 For instan@@ ce, the ob@@ es@@ ity r@@ ate in my neighbor@@ hood is five times high@@ er th@@ an, say, B@@ ever@@ ly H@@ ill@@ s, which is probably ei@@ ght, 10 miles a@@ way.    
 I got ti@@ red of seeing this happen@@ ing.    
 And I was wonder@@ ing, how would you feel if you had no acc@@ ess to health@@ y food, if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effec@@ ts that the present food system has on your neighbor@@ h@@ oo@@ d?    
 I see whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir@@ s b@@ ought and so@@ ld like used car@@ s.    
 I see di@@ aly@@ sis cent@@ ers pop@@ ping up like St@@ ar@@ b@@ uc@@ ks.    
 And I figu@@ re@@ d, this has to stop@@ .    
 So I figu@@ red that the problem is the solu@@ tion.    
 F@@ ood is the problem and food is the solu@@ tion.    
 P@@ l@@ us I got ti@@ red of dri@@ ving 4@@ 5 minut@@ es rou@@ nd tri@@ p to get an app@@ le that wasn't imp@@ re@@ g@@ n@@ ated with p@@ es@@ tic@@ id@@ es.    
 So what I di@@ d, I plan@@ ted a food fore@@ st in front of my hous@@ e.    
 It was on a stri@@ p of land that we call a par@@ k@@ way.    
 It's 1@@ 50 fe@@ et by 10 fe@@ e@@ t.    
 Th@@ ing is, it's ow@@ ned by the city.    
 But you have to main@@ tain it.    
 So I'm like, "@@ Co@@ ol@@ . I can do what@@ ever the hel@@ l I wan@@ t, since it's my respon@@ sib@@ ility and I go@@ tt@@ a main@@ tain it@@ ."    
 And this is how I decided to main@@ tain it.    
 So me and my grou@@ p, L@@ .@@ A@@ . Gre@@ en G@@ rou@@ n@@ ds, we got together and we started plan@@ ting my food fore@@ st, fru@@ it tre@@ es, you know, the whole n@@ ine, ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ les.    
 What we do, we're a pa@@ y@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ forward kind of grou@@ p, where it's comp@@ osed of gar@@ den@@ ers from all wal@@ ks of life, from all over the c@@ ity, and it's completely volunte@@ er, and everything we do is fre@@ e.    
 And the gar@@ d@@ en, it was beauti@@ ful.    
 And then somebody comp@@ la@@ in@@ ed.    
 The city came down on me, and basically gave me a c@@ it@@ ation sa@@ ying that I had to re@@ move my gar@@ d@@ en, which this c@@ it@@ ation was tur@@ ning into a war@@ ran@@ t.    
 And I'm like, "@@ C@@ ome on, re@@ all@@ y?    
 A war@@ r@@ ant for plan@@ ting food on a piece of land that you could care less ab@@ out@@ ?" And I was like, "@@ Co@@ ol@@ . Br@@ ing it@@ ."    
 Because this time it wasn't coming up.    
 So L@@ .@@ A@@ . T@@ im@@ es got a@@ hold of it. Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z did a story on it and talked to the coun@@ c@@ il@@ man, and one of the Gre@@ en G@@ rou@@ n@@ ds memb@@ ers, they put up a pe@@ ti@@ tion on C@@ han@@ ge@@ .@@ org@@ , and with 9@@ 00 sig@@ natu@@ re@@ s, we were a succ@@ ess.    
 We had a vic@@ tor@@ y on our han@@ ds.    
 My coun@@ c@@ il@@ man even called in and said how they end@@ or@@ se and love what we're do@@ ing.    
 I mean, come on, why wouldn't the@@ y?    
 L@@ .@@ A@@ . lead@@ s the United States in v@@ ac@@ ant lots that the city actually ow@@ n@@ s.    
 They own 2@@ 6 squ@@ are miles of v@@ ac@@ ant lo@@ ts.    
 That's 20 C@@ ent@@ ral Par@@ ks.    
 That's enough space to plant 7@@ 2@@ 5 million tom@@ a@@ to plan@@ ts.    
 Why in the hel@@ l would they not oka@@ y this?    
 G@@ row@@ ing one plant will give you 1@@ ,00@@ 0, 10@@ ,000 se@@ ed@@ s.    
 When one dollar@@ 's worth of gre@@ en be@@ ans will give you 7@@ 5 dollar@@ s' worth of produc@@ e.    
 It's my go@@ sp@@ el, when I'm telling people, grow your own foo@@ d.    
 G@@ row@@ ing your own food is like prin@@ ting your own mone@@ y.    
   Se@@ e, I have a leg@@ ac@@ y in South C@@ ent@@ r@@ al.    
 I grew up there. I rais@@ ed my s@@ ons there.    
 And I ref@@ use to be a part of this man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ red reality that was man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ red for me by some other people, and I'm man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ing my own real@@ ity.    
 Se@@ e, I'm an arti@@ st.    
 G@@ ar@@ den@@ ing is my gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ . I grow my ar@@ t.    
 Just like a gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i arti@@ st, where they beauti@@ fy w@@ all@@ s, me, I beauti@@ fy law@@ n@@ s, par@@ k@@ wa@@ y@@ s.    
 I use the gar@@ d@@ en, the so@@ il, like it's a piece of clo@@ th, and the plan@@ ts and the tre@@ es, that's my em@@ bel@@ li@@ sh@@ ment for that clo@@ th.    
 You@@ 'd be surpri@@ sed what the so@@ il could do if you let it be your can@@ v@@ as@@ .    
 You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sun@@ flow@@ er is and how it affec@@ ts people.    
 So what happen@@ ed@@ ?    
 I have wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed my gar@@ d@@ en become a tool for the edu@@ cation, a tool for the trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tion of my neighbor@@ h@@ oo@@ d.    
 To change the commun@@ ity, you have to change the comp@@ os@@ i@@ tion of the so@@ il.    
 We are the so@@ il.    
 You@@ 'd be surpri@@ sed how kids are affec@@ ted by this.    
 G@@ ar@@ den@@ ing is the most ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic and de@@ fi@@ ant act you can do, especially in the inner city.    
 P@@ l@@ us you get stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ri@@ es.    
   I remember this time, there was this mother and a daughter ca@@ me, it was, like, 10@@ :@@ 30 at night, and they were in my y@@ ar@@ d, and I came out and they looked so as@@ ha@@ me@@ d.    
 So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there, and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.    
 It made me feel as@@ ha@@ med to see people that were this close to me that were hun@@ gr@@ y, and this only re@@ infor@@ c@@ ed why I do this, and people asked me, "@@ F@@ in, aren't you afraid people are going to ste@@ al your foo@@ d@@ ?"    
 And I'm like, "H@@ ell no@@ , I ain@@ 't afraid they're g@@ on@@ n@@ a ste@@ al it.    
 That's why it's on the stree@@ t.    
 That's the whole idea@@ .    
 I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back their health@@ ."    
 There's another time when I put a gar@@ d@@ en in this hom@@ el@@ ess sh@@ el@@ ter in down@@ town L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es.    
 These are the gu@@ ys, they helped me un@@ lo@@ ad the truc@@ k.    
 It was co@@ ol@@ , and they just sha@@ red the stories about how this affec@@ ted them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grand@@ mother@@ , and it was just c@@ ool to see how this changed them, if it was only for that one mom@@ ent.    
 So Gre@@ en G@@ rou@@ n@@ ds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gar@@ den@@ s.    
 We've ha@@ d, like, 50 people come to our dig@@ -@@ ins and partici@@ pat@@ e, and it's all volunte@@ ers.    
 If kids grow k@@ al@@ e, kids e@@ at k@@ al@@ e.    
   If they grow tom@@ at@@ o@@ es, they e@@ at tom@@ at@@ o@@ es. But when n@@ one of this is present@@ ed to them, if they're not shown how food affec@@ ts the mind and the bod@@ y, they bl@@ in@@ d@@ ly e@@ at what@@ ever the hel@@ l you put in front of them.    
 I see young people and they want to work, but they're in this thing where they're caught up -- I see kids of color and they're just on this tr@@ ack that's desig@@ ned for them, that lead@@ s them to no@@ wher@@ e.    
 So with gar@@ den@@ ing, I see an opportunity where we can tra@@ in these kids to take over their communi@@ ties, to have a sustain@@ able life.    
 And when we do this, who know@@ s?    
 We might produce the next G@@ e@@ or@@ ge W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on C@@ ar@@ ver.    
 but if we don't change the comp@@ os@@ i@@ tion of the so@@ il, we will never do this.    
 Now this is one of my plan@@ s. This is what I want to do.    
 I want to plant a whole b@@ lo@@ ck of gar@@ den@@ s where people can share in the food in the same bloc@@ k.    
 I want to take shi@@ pp@@ ing con@@ tain@@ ers and turn them into health@@ y ca@@ f@@ es.    
 Now don't get me wr@@ ong@@ .    
 I'm not talking about no free sh@@ it, because free is not sustain@@ able.    
 The fun@@ ny thing about sustain@@ ab@@ il@@ ity, you have to su@@ sta@@ in it.    
    What I'm talking about is putting people to work, and getting kids off the stree@@ t, and le@@ tting them know the jo@@ y, the pri@@ de and the hon@@ or in growing your own food, op@@ ening far@@ mer@@ 's marke@@ ts.    
 So what I want to do here, we go@@ tt@@ a make this sex@@ y.    
 So I want us all to become ec@@ olu@@ tionary re@@ ne@@ g@@ ad@@ es, g@@ ang@@ st@@ as, g@@ ang@@ st@@ a gar@@ den@@ ers.    
 We go@@ tt@@ a f@@ li@@ p the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ t on what a g@@ ang@@ st@@ a is.    
 If you ain@@ 't a gar@@ den@@ er, you ain@@ 't g@@ ang@@ sta@@ .    
 G@@ et g@@ ang@@ st@@ a with your sho@@ vel@@ , oka@@ y?    
 And let that be your we@@ ap@@ on of choic@@ e.    
   So bas@@ ic@@ ally, if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to me@@ e@@ t, don't call me if you want to s@@ it around in c@@ us@@ h@@ y cha@@ ir@@ s and have me@@ et@@ ings where you talk about doing some sh@@ it -- where you talk about doing some sh@@ it.    
 If you want to meet with me, come to the gar@@ d@@ en with your sho@@ vel so we can plant some sh@@ it.    
 Pe@@ ac@@ e. Thank you.    
   Thank you.     
        You probably all ag@@ ree with me that this is a very n@@ ice roa@@ d.    
 It's made of as@@ ph@@ al@@ t, and as@@ ph@@ al@@ t is a very n@@ ice materi@@ al to dri@@ ve on, but not al@@ wa@@ ys, especially not on these days as today, when it's ra@@ ining a lo@@ t.    
 Then you can have a lot of sp@@ las@@ h water in the as@@ ph@@ al@@ t.    
 And especially if you then ri@@ de with your b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le, and pas@@ s these car@@ s, then that's not very n@@ ic@@ e.    
 Al@@ so, as@@ ph@@ al@@ t can create a lot of no@@ is@@ e.    
 It's a no@@ is@@ y materi@@ al, and if we produce ro@@ ad@@ s like in the N@@ e@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds, very close to ci@@ ties, then we would like a sil@@ ent roa@@ d.    
 The solu@@ tion for that is to make ro@@ ad@@ s out of por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t.    
 in most of the high@@ ways in the N@@ e@@ ther@@ lan@@ ds, it has po@@ res and water can just ra@@ in through it, so all the ra@@ in@@ water will f@@ low away to the sid@@ es, and you have a road that's easy to dri@@ ve on, so no sp@@ las@@ h water any@@ more.    
 Al@@ so the no@@ ise will disap@@ pe@@ ar in these po@@ re@@ s.    
 Because it's very hol@@ low@@ , all the no@@ ise will disap@@ pe@@ ar, so it's a very sil@@ ent roa@@ d.    
 It also has disa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ g@@ es, of course, and the disa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of this road is that ra@@ vel@@ ing can oc@@ cur@@ .    
 What is ra@@ vel@@ ing? You see that in this road that the st@@ ones at the sur@@ face come off.    
 Fir@@ st you get one st@@ one, then several mo@@ re, and more and more and more and mo@@ re, and then they -- well, I will not do that. But they can da@@ mage your win@@ d@@ shi@@ el@@ d, so you're not happy with that.    
 And finally, this ra@@ vel@@ ing can also le@@ ad to more and more da@@ mag@@ e.    
 Some@@ times you can create po@@ th@@ ol@@ es with that.    
 H@@ a. H@@ e's read@@ y.    
 P@@ o@@ th@@ ol@@ es, of course, that can become a proble@@ m, but we have a solu@@ tion.    
 Here you see actually how the da@@ mage appe@@ ars in this materi@@ al.    
 It's a por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t, like I said, so you have only a small amount of b@@ in@@ der between the st@@ on@@ es.    
 D@@ ue to wea@@ ther@@ ing, du@@ e to U.@@ V@@ . li@@ ght, du@@ e to o@@ x@@ id@@ ation, this b@@ in@@ d@@ er, this b@@ it@@ um@@ en, the g@@ l@@ ue between the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates is going to sh@@ rin@@ k, and if it sh@@ rin@@ ks, it gets micro@@ -@@ crac@@ ks, and it del@@ am@@ in@@ ates from the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ at@@ es.    
 Then if you dri@@ ve over the roa@@ d, you take out the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates -- what we just saw here.    
 To solve this proble@@ m, we thought of self-@@ heal@@ ing materi@@ als.    
 If we can make this materi@@ al self-@@ heal@@ ing, then probably we have a solu@@ tion.    
 So what we can do is use ste@@ el w@@ ool just to clean pan@@ s, and the ste@@ el w@@ ool we can c@@ ut in very small piec@@ es, and these very small pieces we can mi@@ x to the b@@ it@@ um@@ en.    
 So then you have as@@ ph@@ al@@ t with very small pieces of ste@@ el w@@ ool in it.    
 Then you need a mach@@ ine, like you see here, that you can use for c@@ oo@@ king -- an in@@ duc@@ tion mach@@ ine.    
 In@@ duc@@ tion can he@@ at, especially ste@@ el@@ ; it's very good at that.    
 Then what you do is you he@@ at up the ste@@ el, you m@@ el@@ t the b@@ it@@ um@@ en, and the b@@ itu@@ men will f@@ low into these micro@@ -@@ crac@@ ks, and the st@@ ones are again fi@@ x@@ ed to the sur@@ fac@@ e.    
 To@@ day I use a micro@@ wa@@ ve because I cannot take the big in@@ duc@@ tion machine here on@@ st@@ age.    
 So a micro@@ wa@@ ve is a si@@ mil@@ ar system.    
 So I put the speci@@ men in, which I'm now going to take out to see what happen@@ ed.    
 So this is the speci@@ men coming out now.    
 So I said we have such an indu@@ stri@@ al machine in the la@@ b to he@@ at up the speci@@ men@@ s.    
 We tes@@ ted a lot of speci@@ men@@ s there, and then the govern@@ ment, they actually saw our resul@@ ts, and they thought, "Well, that's very interes@@ t@@ ing. We have to try that@@ ."    
 So they don@@ ated to us a piece of high@@ way, 4@@ 00 me@@ ters of the A@@ 5@@ 8@@ , where we had to make So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test roa@@ d, and then of course this road will last several years without any da@@ mag@@ e. That's what we know from prac@@ tic@@ e.    
 So we took a lot of sam@@ ples from this road and we tes@@ ted them in the lab@@ .    
 So we did ag@@ ing on the sam@@ pl@@ es, did a lot of lo@@ ad@@ ing on it, heal@@ ed them with our in@@ duc@@ tion mach@@ ine, and heal@@ ed them and tes@@ ted them again.    
 S@@ ever@@ al times we can re@@ pe@@ at that.    
 So actu@@ ally, the con@@ cl@@ usi@@ on from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our heal@@ ing machine -- this is the big ver@@ sion we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can d@@ ou@@ ble the sur@@ face life of this roa@@ d, which of course sa@@ ves a lot of mone@@ y.    
 Well, to con@@ cl@@ u@@ de, I can say that we made a materi@@ al using ste@@ el fi@@ b@@ ers, the ad@@ di@@ tion of ste@@ el fi@@ b@@ ers, using in@@ duc@@ tion energy to really increase the sur@@ face life of the roa@@ d, d@@ ou@@ ble the sur@@ face life you can even do, so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tric@@ ks.    
 And now you're of course curi@@ ous if it also wor@@ ke@@ d.    
 So we still have the speci@@ men here. It's quite war@@ m.    
 A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally, it still has to c@@ ool down first before I can show you that the heal@@ ing work@@ s.    
 But I will do a tri@@ al.    
 Let's se@@ e. Yea@@ h, it wor@@ ke@@ d.    
 Thank you.    
 When I was 1@@ 1, I remember wa@@ king up one mor@@ ning to the sound of jo@@ y in my hous@@ e.    
 My father was list@@ ening to B@@ B@@ C N@@ ew@@ s on his sm@@ all, gra@@ y radi@@ o.    
 There was a big s@@ mi@@ le on his face which was un@@ usu@@ al then, because the news mo@@ st@@ ly de@@ pres@@ sed him.    
 "The T@@ ali@@ b@@ an are g@@ one@@ !@@ " my father sh@@ ou@@ ted.    
 I didn't know what it mean@@ t, but I could see that my father was very, very happ@@ y.    
 "@@ You can go to a real school now@@ ," he said@@ .    
 A mor@@ ning that I will never for@@ ge@@ t.    
 A real school.    
 You see, I was six when the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an took over Af@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an and made it il@@ leg@@ al for girls to go to school.    
 So for the next five years, I dres@@ sed as a boy to es@@ cor@@ t my ol@@ der sist@@ er, who was no longer allow@@ ed to be outside al@@ one, to a secre@@ t school.    
 It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated.    
 E@@ ach day, we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would s@@ us@@ pect where we were go@@ ing.    
 We would co@@ ver our books in g@@ ro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ag@@ s so it would seem we were just out shop@@ p@@ ing.    
 The school was in a hous@@ e, more than 100 of us pac@@ ked in one small living room.    
 It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but ex@@ trem@@ ely ho@@ t in sum@@ mer@@ .    
 We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives -- the teach@@ er, the students and our paren@@ ts.    
 F@@ rom time to time, the school would suddenly be can@@ c@@ el@@ ed for a week because T@@ ali@@ b@@ an were s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ ous.    
 We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us.    
 W@@ ere we being fol@@ lo@@ we@@ d?    
 Do they know where we liv@@ e?    
 We were s@@ care@@ d, but sti@@ ll@@ , school was where we wanted to be.    
 I was very luck@@ y to grow up in a family where edu@@ cation was pri@@ zed and daugh@@ ters were tre@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ d.    
 My grand@@ father was an extraordinary man for his time.    
 A to@@ tal ma@@ ver@@ ic@@ k from a re@@ mo@@ te pro@@ v@@ in@@ ce of Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan@@ , he in@@ sist@@ ed that his daugh@@ ter, my mom@@ , go to school, and for that he was dis@@ ow@@ ned by his father@@ .    
 But my educ@@ ated mother became a te@@ ac@@ her@@ .    
 There she is.    
 She re@@ ti@@ red two years ago, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighbor@@ h@@ oo@@ d.    
 And my father -- that's him -- he was the first ever in his family to recei@@ ve an edu@@ ca@@ tion.    
 There was no question that his children would recei@@ ve an edu@@ cation, including his daugh@@ ters, des@@ p@@ ite the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an, des@@ p@@ ite the risk@@ s.    
 To him, there was great@@ er ris@@ k in not educ@@ ating his children@@ .    
 D@@ ur@@ ing T@@ ali@@ b@@ an years, I remember there were times I would get so fru@@ str@@ ated by our life and always being s@@ ca@@ red and not seeing a fu@@ ture.    
 I would want to qu@@ it, but my father@@ , he would say, "@@ L@@ ist@@ en, my daugh@@ ter, you can lo@@ se everything you own in your life.    
 Y@@ our money can be st@@ ol@@ en. You can be forced to leave your home during a war@@ .    
 But the one thing that will always re@@ main with you is what is here, and if we have to sel@@ l our blood to pa@@ y your school fe@@ es, we will@@ .    
 So do you still not want to contin@@ u@@ e@@ ?"    
 To@@ day I am 2@@ 2@@ .    
 I was rais@@ ed in a country that has been des@@ tro@@ yed by deca@@ des of war@@ . F@@ ew@@ er than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school, and had my family not been so comm@@ it@@ ted to my edu@@ cation, I would be one of them.    
 Instea@@ d, I stand here a p@@ rou@@ d gradu@@ ate of M@@ idd@@ le@@ bur@@ y C@@ ol@@ leg@@ e.    
   When I re@@ turned to Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan@@ , my grand@@ father@@ , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his daugh@@ ters, was am@@ ong the first to con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me.    
 He not only bra@@ g@@ s about my colle@@ ge degre@@ e, but also that I was the first wom@@ an, and that I am the first woman to dri@@ ve him through the stree@@ ts of K@@ ab@@ ul@@ .    
   My family believ@@ es in me.    
 I dream bi@@ g, but my family dre@@ ams even bigg@@ er for me.    
 That's why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10@@ , a global camp@@ a@@ ign to educ@@ ate wom@@ en.    
 That's why I co@@ foun@@ ded S@@ O@@ L@@ A@@ , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan@@ , a country where it's still risk@@ y for girls to go to school.    
 The exc@@ iting thing is that I see students at my school with ambi@@ tion gr@@ ab@@ bing at opportun@@ ity.    
 And I see their parents and their father@@ s wh@@ o, like my ow@@ n, adv@@ oc@@ ate for them, des@@ p@@ ite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ posi@@ tion.    
 Li@@ ke A@@ h@@ me@@ d. That's not his real nam@@ e, and I cannot show you his fac@@ e, but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my stud@@ ents.    
 L@@ ess than a mon@@ th ago, he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ L@@ A to their v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ e, and they literally mis@@ sed being killed by a ro@@ ad@@ side b@@ om@@ b by minut@@ es.    
 As he arri@@ ved hom@@ e, the phone ran@@ g, a vo@@ ice war@@ ning him that if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again.    
 "@@ K@@ ill me now, if you wi@@ sh@@ ," he said, "@@ but I will not ru@@ in my daugh@@ ter@@ 's future because of your old and back@@ ward ide@@ as@@ ."    
 What I've come to realize about Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan@@ , and this is something that is often di@@ sm@@ is@@ sed in the W@@ es@@ t, that behind most of us who succ@@ e@@ ed is a father who recog@@ n@@ iz@@ es the value in his daughter and who se@@ es that her success is his succ@@ ess.    
 It's not to say that our mother@@ s aren't key in our succ@@ ess.    
 In fact, they're often the initi@@ al and con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing ne@@ go@@ ti@@ at@@ ors of a b@@ right future for their daugh@@ ters, but in the cont@@ ext of a society like in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan@@ , we must have the supp@@ ort of m@@ en.    
 Un@@ der the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an, girls who went to school numb@@ ered in the hundreds -- rememb@@ er, it was il@@ leg@@ al.    
 But today, more than three million girls are in school in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan@@ .    
   Af@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an looks so different from here in Ameri@@ ca@@ .    
 I find that Americ@@ ans see the fra@@ g@@ ility in chang@@ es.    
 I fe@@ ar that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. tro@@ op@@ s' with@@ dra@@ wal@@ .    
 But when I am back in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan@@ , when I see the students in my school and their parents who adv@@ oc@@ ate for them, who en@@ courage them, I see a prom@@ is@@ ing future and la@@ sting change.    
 To me, Af@@ gh@@ an@@ ist@@ an is a country of hope and boun@@ d@@ less possibili@@ ties, and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ L@@ A re@@ mind me of that.    
 Li@@ ke me, they are dre@@ am@@ ing bi@@ g@@ .    
 Thank you.    
 I have ne@@ ver, ever for@@ gotten the words of my grand@@ mother who died in her ex@@ i@@ le@@ : "@@ S@@ on, re@@ si@@ st G@@ ad@@ da@@ fi@@ . F@@ ight him.    
 But don't you ever turn into a G@@ ad@@ da@@ fi@@ -@@ like re@@ volu@@ tion@@ ar@@ y."    
 Al@@ most two years have pas@@ sed since the Li@@ by@@ an R@@ evolution bro@@ ke out, inspi@@ red by the wa@@ ves of ma@@ ss mobi@@ li@@ z@@ ation in both the T@@ uni@@ si@@ an and the Egyp@@ ti@@ an re@@ volu@@ tions.    
 I jo@@ ined forc@@ es with many other Li@@ by@@ ans inside and outside Li@@ by@@ a to call for a day of ra@@ ge and to initi@@ ate a re@@ volu@@ tion against the ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal re@@ gi@@ me of G@@ ad@@ da@@ fi@@ .    
 And there it was, a great re@@ volu@@ tion.    
 Y@@ oun@@ g Li@@ by@@ an women and men were at the fore@@ front call@@ ing for the f@@ all of the re@@ gi@@ me, rais@@ ing s@@ log@@ ans of fre@@ ed@@ om@@ , dig@@ n@@ ity, social jus@@ tic@@ e.    
 They have shown an ex@@ emp@@ l@@ ary bra@@ very in conf@@ ron@@ ting the br@@ ut@@ al dic@@ t@@ ator@@ ship of G@@ ad@@ da@@ fi@@ .    
 They have shown a great sense of so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity from the far e@@ ast to the far w@@ est to the sou@@ th.    
 E@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally, after a peri@@ od of six months of br@@ ut@@ al wa@@ r and a t@@ ol@@ l r@@ ate of almost 5@@ 0@@ ,000 dea@@ d, we manag@@ ed to li@@ ber@@ ate our country and to top@@ ple the ty@@ ran@@ t.    
   H@@ o@@ we@@ ver, G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i left behind a hea@@ v@@ y bur@@ d@@ en, a leg@@ ac@@ y of ty@@ ran@@ n@@ y, cor@@ ru@@ p@@ tion and see@@ ds of di@@ ver@@ sion@@ s.    
 For four deca@@ des G@@ ad@@ da@@ fi@@ 's ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal re@@ gi@@ me des@@ tro@@ yed the in@@ fra@@ struc@@ ture as well as the culture and the mor@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of Li@@ by@@ an societ@@ y.    
 A@@ w@@ are of the de@@ va@@ st@@ ation and the challeng@@ es, I was ke@@ en am@@ ong many other women to re@@ build the Li@@ by@@ an ci@@ vi@@ l societ@@ y, call@@ ing for an incl@@ usi@@ ve and just tran@@ si@@ tion to demo@@ crac@@ y and national re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation.    
 Al@@ most 2@@ 00 organ@@ iz@@ ations were es@@ tab@@ li@@ sh@@ ed in B@@ eng@@ ha@@ z@@ i during and im@@ medi@@ ately after the f@@ all of G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i -- almost 3@@ 00 in T@@ ri@@ poli@@ .    
 Af@@ ter a peri@@ od of 3@@ 3 years in ex@@ i@@ le, I went back to Li@@ by@@ a, and with unique en@@ th@@ usi@@ as@@ m, I started organ@@ izing work@@ shop@@ s on cap@@ ac@@ ity build@@ ing, on human development of lead@@ er@@ ship sk@@ ill@@ s.    
 With an amazing group of wom@@ en, I co@@ -@@ foun@@ ded the Li@@ by@@ an W@@ om@@ en@@ 's P@@ lat@@ form for Pe@@ ac@@ e, a mov@@ ement of wom@@ en, lead@@ ers, from different wal@@ ks of life, to lo@@ b@@ by for the soci@@ op@@ o@@ li@@ tical em@@ power@@ ment of women and to lo@@ b@@ by for our right for equ@@ al partici@@ pa@@ tion in building demo@@ crac@@ y and pe@@ ac@@ e.    
 I met a very difficult environment in the pre@@ -@@ elec@@ tions, an environment which was increas@@ ingly pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ed, an environment which was sha@@ ped by the self@@ ish poli@@ tics of dom@@ in@@ ance and ex@@ cl@@ usi@@ on.    
 I led an initi@@ ative by the Li@@ by@@ an W@@ om@@ en@@ 's P@@ lat@@ form for Pe@@ ace to lo@@ b@@ by for a more incl@@ usi@@ ve elec@@ tor@@ al law@@ , a la@@ w that would give every citi@@ z@@ en, no matter what your back@@ grou@@ n@@ d, the right to vo@@ te and run@@ , and most import@@ an@@ tly to sti@@ pul@@ ate on political par@@ ties the alter@@ n@@ ation of male and fe@@ male can@@ di@@ dat@@ es ver@@ tically and hor@@ iz@@ on@@ tally in their list@@ s, creating the z@@ i@@ pp@@ er li@@ st.    
 E@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally, our initi@@ ative was ad@@ op@@ ted and success@@ ful.    
 W@@ om@@ en w@@ on 1@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent of the Na@@ tional C@@ ong@@ res@@ s in the first elec@@ tions ever in 5@@ 2 years.    
   H@@ o@@ we@@ ver, bit by b@@ it, the e@@ u@@ ph@@ ori@@ a of the elec@@ tions, and of the re@@ volu@@ tion as a who@@ le, was f@@ ad@@ ing out -- for every day we were wa@@ king up to the news of viol@@ ence.    
 One day we wa@@ ke up to the news of the des@@ ec@@ ra@@ tion of ancient m@@ os@@ qu@@ es and Su@@ f@@ i tom@@ b@@ s.    
 On another day we wa@@ ke up to the news of the m@@ ur@@ der of the American am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or and the att@@ ack on the con@@ su@@ lat@@ e.    
 On another day we wa@@ ke up to the news of the as@@ s@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of ar@@ my offic@@ ers.    
 And every day, every day we wa@@ ke up with the ru@@ le of the mi@@ li@@ ti@@ as and their contin@@ u@@ ous viol@@ ations of human rights of pri@@ son@@ ers and their dis@@ res@@ pect of the ru@@ le of law@@ .    
 Our societ@@ y, sha@@ ped by a re@@ volu@@ tionary mind@@ se@@ t, became more pol@@ ar@@ ized and has dri@@ ven away from the ide@@ als and the prin@@ ci@@ ples -- fre@@ ed@@ om@@ , dig@@ n@@ ity, social jus@@ tice -- that we first hel@@ d.    
 In@@ t@@ ol@@ er@@ anc@@ e, ex@@ cl@@ usi@@ on and re@@ ven@@ ge became the ic@@ ons of the [@@ af@@ ter@@ ma@@ th@@ ] of the re@@ volu@@ tion.    
 I am here today not at all to inspi@@ re you with our success story of the z@@ i@@ pp@@ er li@@ st and the elec@@ tions.    
 I'm rather here today to conf@@ ess that we as a n@@ ation took the wrong choic@@ e, made the wrong deci@@ sion.    
 We did not pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze right.    
 For elec@@ tions did not bring pe@@ ace and st@@ ability and se@@ cur@@ ity in Li@@ by@@ a.    
 D@@ id the z@@ i@@ pp@@ er li@@ st and the alter@@ n@@ ation between fe@@ male and male can@@ di@@ dat@@ es bring pe@@ ace and national re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ a@@ tion@@ ?    
 No, it di@@ d@@ n'@@ t.    
 What is it, th@@ en@@ ?    
 Why does our society contin@@ ue to be pol@@ ar@@ ized and dom@@ in@@ ated with self@@ ish poli@@ tics of dom@@ in@@ ance and ex@@ cl@@ usi@@ on, by both men and wom@@ en@@ ?    
 Maybe what was mis@@ sing was not the women on@@ ly, but the femin@@ ine valu@@ es of comp@@ as@@ sion, mer@@ c@@ y and incl@@ usi@@ on.    
 Our society needs national di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e and con@@ sen@@ s@@ us@@ -@@ building more than it needed the elec@@ tions, which only re@@ infor@@ c@@ ed pol@@ ar@@ iz@@ ation and di@@ vi@@ sion.    
 Our society needs the qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative represent@@ ation of the femin@@ ine more than it needs the nu@@ mer@@ ic@@ al, quan@@ ti@@ ta@@ tive represent@@ ation of the femin@@ ine.    
 We need to stop ac@@ ting as ag@@ ents of ra@@ ge and call@@ ing for days of ra@@ g@@ e.    
 We need to start ac@@ ting as ag@@ ents of comp@@ as@@ sion and mer@@ c@@ y.    
 We need to de@@ vel@@ op a femin@@ ine dis@@ course that not only hon@@ ors but also imp@@ le@@ ments mer@@ c@@ y instead of re@@ v@@ eng@@ e, collabor@@ ation instead of compe@@ ti@@ tion, incl@@ usi@@ on instead of ex@@ cl@@ usi@@ on.    
 These are the ide@@ als that a war@@ -@@ tor@@ n Li@@ by@@ a needs des@@ per@@ ately in order to achi@@ eve pe@@ ac@@ e.    
 For pe@@ ace has an al@@ chem@@ y, and this al@@ che@@ my is about the inter@@ tw@@ in@@ ing, the alter@@ n@@ ation between the femin@@ ine and ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ ine perspec@@ tiv@@ es.    
 That's the real z@@ i@@ p@@ per@@ .    
 And we need to es@@ tab@@ lish that exist@@ entially before we do so soci@@ op@@ o@@ li@@ tic@@ ally.    
 A@@ cc@@ or@@ ding to a Q@@ ur@@ an@@ ic ver@@ se "@@ S@@ al@@ am@@ " -- pe@@ ace -- "@@ is the word of the all@@ -@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful Go@@ d, ra@@ he@@ em@@ ."    
 In tur@@ n, the word "@@ ra@@ he@@ em@@ ," which is known in all A@@ bra@@ ha@@ mi@@ c tra@@ di@@ tions, has the same roo@@ t in Ar@@ ab@@ ic as the word "@@ ra@@ h@@ em@@ " -- wom@@ b -- sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ zing the mat@@ er@@ n@@ al femin@@ ine en@@ comp@@ as@@ sing all human@@ ity from which the male and the fe@@ mal@@ e, from which all tri@@ b@@ es, all peop@@ l@@ es, have e@@ man@@ ated from@@ .    
 And so just as the wom@@ b enti@@ rely en@@ velop@@ es the em@@ br@@ y@@ o, which grow@@ s within it, the di@@ v@@ ine mat@@ ri@@ x of comp@@ as@@ sion n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ es the entire exist@@ ence.    
 Th@@ us we are told that "@@ My mer@@ c@@ y en@@ comp@@ as@@ ses all thing@@ s."    
 Th@@ us we are told that "@@ My mer@@ c@@ y takes p@@ rec@@ ed@@ ence over my ang@@ er@@ ."    
 Ma@@ y we all be gran@@ ted a gr@@ ace of mer@@ c@@ y.    
   Thank you.    
 I'm here today to talk about a dist@@ ur@@ bing ques@@ tion, which has an equ@@ ally dist@@ ur@@ bing answ@@ er.    
 My top@@ ic is the secre@@ ts of domestic viol@@ ence, and the question I'm going to t@@ ack@@ le is the one question everyone always as@@ k@@ s: Why does she sta@@ y?    
 Why would anyone sta@@ y with a man who be@@ at@@ s her@@ ?    
 I'm not a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ st, a social work@@ er or an exper@@ t in domestic viol@@ ence.    
 I'm just one woman with a story to tel@@ l@@ .    
 I was 2@@ 2@@ . I had just gradu@@ ated from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard C@@ ol@@ leg@@ e.    
 I had moved to New York C@@ ity for my first job as a writ@@ er and ed@@ it@@ or at S@@ ev@@ ent@@ e@@ en mag@@ az@@ ine.    
 I had my first a@@ part@@ ment, my first little gre@@ en American E@@ x@@ pres@@ s car@@ d, and I had a very big secre@@ t.    
 My secre@@ t was that I had this gu@@ n lo@@ ad@@ ed with hol@@ low@@ -@@ point bul@@ le@@ ts poin@@ ted at my head by the man who I thought was my sou@@ l@@ mat@@ e, man@@ y, many times.    
 The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth hel@@ d a gu@@ n to my head and thre@@ at@@ ened to kill me more times than I can even rememb@@ er.    
 I'm here to tell you the story of crazy lo@@ ve, a psycho@@ logical tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as lo@@ ve, one that milli@@ ons of women and even a few men f@@ all into every year.    
 It may even be your story.    
 I don't look like a typical domestic violence survi@@ v@@ or.    
 I have a B@@ .@@ A@@ . in Eng@@ lish from H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard C@@ ol@@ leg@@ e, an M@@ B@@ A in marke@@ ting from Wh@@ ar@@ t@@ on B@@ us@@ iness S@@ chool@@ .    
 I've spent most of my care@@ er working for F@@ or@@ tu@@ ne 500 companies including Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son & Jo@@ h@@ n@@ s@@ on, Le@@ o B@@ ur@@ net@@ t and The W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on P@@ o@@ st.    
 I've been married for almost 20 years to my second h@@ us@@ b@@ and and we have three kids together.    
 My do@@ g is a black lab@@ , and I dri@@ ve a H@@ on@@ d@@ a O@@ dy@@ s@@ se@@ y min@@ i@@ v@@ an.    
   So my first messa@@ ge for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all rac@@ es, all reli@@ gi@@ on@@ s, all in@@ come and edu@@ cation level@@ s.    
 It's every@@ wher@@ e.    
 And my second messa@@ ge is that everyone thin@@ ks domestic violence happens to wom@@ en, that it's a wom@@ en@@ 's issu@@ e.    
 Not exac@@ t@@ ly.    
 O@@ ver 8@@ 5 percent of ab@@ us@@ ers are m@@ en, and domestic ab@@ use happens only in in@@ tim@@ at@@ e, inter@@ dep@@ end@@ ent, long@@ -@@ term relationshi@@ ps, in other words, in famili@@ es, the last place we would want or ex@@ pect to find viol@@ ence, which is one reason domestic ab@@ use is so conf@@ us@@ ing.    
 I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would sta@@ y with a man who be@@ at@@ s me, but in fact I was a very typical vic@@ ti@@ m because of my age.    
 I was 2@@ 2@@ , and in the United St@@ ates, women ages 1@@ 6 to 2@@ 4 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victim@@ s as women of other ag@@ es, and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by ab@@ usi@@ ve part@@ n@@ ers, bo@@ y@@ friends, and h@@ us@@ b@@ ands in the United St@@ at@@ es.    
 I was also a very typical vic@@ ti@@ m because I knew nothing about domestic viol@@ ence, its war@@ ning sig@@ ns or its patter@@ n@@ s.    
 I met Con@@ or on a col@@ d, ra@@ in@@ y J@@ an@@ u@@ ary ni@@ ght.    
 He s@@ at next to me on the New York C@@ ity sub@@ way, and he started ch@@ at@@ ting me up.    
 He told me two things.    
 One was that h@@ e, to@@ o, had just gradu@@ ated from an I@@ v@@ y Le@@ ag@@ ue school, and that he worked at a very imp@@ res@@ sive W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et ban@@ k.    
 But what made the biggest imp@@ res@@ sion on me that first me@@ e@@ ting was that he was smar@@ t and fun@@ ny and he looked like a farm bo@@ y.    
 He had these big che@@ e@@ ks, these big app@@ le che@@ e@@ ks and this whe@@ at@@ -@@ bl@@ ond ha@@ ir@@ , and he seemed so s@@ wee@@ t.    
 One of the smar@@ test things Con@@ or di@@ d, from the very begin@@ ning, was to create the ill@@ usi@@ on that I was the dom@@ in@@ ant part@@ ner in the relationshi@@ p.    
 He did this especially at the beginning by id@@ o@@ li@@ zing me.    
 We started dat@@ ing, and he loved everything about me, that I was smar@@ t, that I'd gone to H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d, that I was pas@@ sion@@ ate about hel@@ ping te@@ en@@ age girl@@ s, and my job@@ .    
 He wanted to know everything about my family and my child@@ hood and my hop@@ es and dre@@ am@@ s.    
 Con@@ or believ@@ ed in me, as a writ@@ er and a wom@@ an, in a way that no one else ever ha@@ d.    
 And he also created a ma@@ gi@@ cal at@@ m@@ os@@ ph@@ ere of trust between us by conf@@ ess@@ ing his secre@@ t, which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four@@ , he had been sa@@ v@@ ag@@ ely and re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly physic@@ ally ab@@ used by his st@@ ep@@ father@@ , and the ab@@ use had gotten so bad that he had had to dro@@ p out of school in ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ de, even though he was very smar@@ t, and he@@ 'd spent almost 20 years re@@ building his life.    
 Wh@@ ich is why that I@@ v@@ y Le@@ ag@@ ue degre@@ e and the W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et job and his b@@ right sh@@ in@@ y future me@@ ant so much to him.    
 If you had told me that this smar@@ t, fun@@ n@@ y, sen@@ si@@ tive man who a@@ do@@ red me would one day dic@@ t@@ ate whether or not I wor@@ e ma@@ ke@@ up, how short my sk@@ ir@@ ts wer@@ e, where I liv@@ ed, what job@@ s I too@@ k, who my friends were and where I spent Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s, I would have la@@ ugh@@ ed at you, because there was not a h@@ in@@ t of violence or control or ang@@ er in Con@@ or at the begin@@ n@@ ing.    
 I didn't know that the first st@@ age in any domestic violence relationship is to se@@ duce and char@@ m the victim@@ .    
 I also didn't know that the second step is to is@@ ol@@ ate the victim@@ .    
 Now, Con@@ or did not come home one day and an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce, "@@ You know, he@@ y, all this R@@ ome@@ o and J@@ u@@ li@@ et stuff has been great@@ , but I need to move into the next p@@ ha@@ se where I is@@ ol@@ ate you and I ab@@ use you@@ " — — "@@ so I need to get you out of this a@@ partment where the neighbor@@ s can hear you scre@@ am and out of this city where you have friends and family and co@@ work@@ ers who can see the br@@ u@@ is@@ es@@ ."    
 Instea@@ d, Con@@ or came home one Fri@@ day even@@ ing and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day, his dream job@@ , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me, because I had made him feel so sa@@ fe and loved that he didn't need to pro@@ ve hi@@ m@@ self on W@@ all S@@ tre@@ et any@@ mo@@ re, and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his ab@@ usi@@ ve, dy@@ s@@ fun@@ c@@ tional family,    
 and move to a tiny town in New Eng@@ land where he could start his life over with me by his sid@@ e.    
 Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New Yor@@ k, and my dream job@@ , but I thought you made s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es for your sou@@ l@@ mat@@ e, so I ag@@ re@@ ed, and I qu@@ it my job@@ , and Con@@ or and I left Man@@ h@@ att@@ an together.    
 I had no idea I was f@@ all@@ ing into crazy lo@@ ve, that I was walking head@@ first into a care@@ fully la@@ id physic@@ al, fin@@ anci@@ al and psycho@@ logical tra@@ p.    
 The next step in the domestic violence patter@@ n is to intro@@ duce the thre@@ at of violence and see how she reac@@ ts.    
 And here's where those g@@ un@@ s come in.    
 As soon as we moved to New Eng@@ land -- you know, that place where Con@@ no@@ r was supposed to feel so sa@@ fe -- he b@@ ought three g@@ un@@ s.    
 He k@@ ept one in the g@@ love com@@ partment of our car@@ .    
 He k@@ ept one under the p@@ il@@ low@@ s on our be@@ d, and the third one he k@@ ept in his po@@ c@@ ket at all times.    
 And he said that he needed those g@@ un@@ s because of the tra@@ um@@ a he@@ 'd experienc@@ ed as a young bo@@ y.    
 He needed them to feel prote@@ c@@ ted.    
 But those g@@ un@@ s were really a messa@@ ge for me, and even though he ha@@ dn't rais@@ ed a hand to me, my life was already in gra@@ ve dang@@ er every min@@ u@@ te of every day.    
 Con@@ or first physic@@ ally att@@ ac@@ ked me five days before our we@@ dd@@ ing.    
 It was 7 a@@ .@@ m. I still had on my ni@@ ght@@ go@@ w@@ n.    
 I was working on my computer trying to fin@@ ish a fre@@ el@@ ance writing assig@@ n@@ ment, and I got fru@@ str@@ ated, and Con@@ or used my ang@@ er as an exc@@ use to put both of his hands around my nec@@ k and to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze so ti@@ ght@@ ly that I could not brea@@ the or scre@@ am, and he used the cho@@ ke@@ hold to hit my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly against the w@@ all.    
 F@@ i@@ ve days later, the ten br@@ u@@ is@@ es on my nec@@ k had just fa@@ ded, and I put on my mother@@ 's we@@ d@@ ding dres@@ s, and I married him.    
 D@@ es@@ p@@ ite what had happen@@ ed, I was sure we were going to live happ@@ ily ever af@@ ter, because I loved him, and he loved me so much.    
 And he was very, very sor@@ r@@ y.    
 He had just been really st@@ res@@ sed out by the we@@ d@@ ding and by be@@ coming a family with me.    
 It was an is@@ ol@@ ated inc@@ id@@ ent, and he was never going to h@@ ur@@ t me again.    
 It happened tw@@ ice more on the hon@@ ey@@ mo@@ on.    
 The first time, I was dri@@ ving to find a secre@@ t be@@ ach and I got lo@@ st, and he p@@ un@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly hit the dri@@ ver@@ 's side win@@ dow@@ .    
 And then a few days later, dri@@ ving home from our hon@@ ey@@ mo@@ on, he got fru@@ str@@ ated by tra@@ ffic@@ , and he thre@@ w a co@@ ld B@@ i@@ g Ma@@ c in my fac@@ e.    
 Con@@ or proc@@ e@@ ed@@ ed to be@@ at me once or tw@@ ice a week for the next two and a half years of our mar@@ ri@@ age.    
 I was mista@@ ken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situ@@ ation.    
 One in three American women experienc@@ es domestic violence or st@@ al@@ king at some point in her life, and the C@@ D@@ C repor@@ ts that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year, 15 milli@@ on.    
 So actu@@ ally, I was in very good compan@@ y.    
 B@@ ack to my ques@@ tion@@ : Why did I sta@@ y?    
 The answer is eas@@ y.    
 I didn't know he was ab@@ using me.    
 E@@ ven though he hel@@ d those lo@@ ad@@ ed g@@ un@@ s to my hea@@ d, push@@ ed me down sta@@ ir@@ s, thre@@ at@@ ened to kill our do@@ g, pul@@ led the key out of the car ig@@ ni@@ tion as I dro@@ ve down the high@@ way, as I dres@@ sed for a job inter@@ view@@ , I never once thought of myself as a bat@@ tered wi@@ f@@ e.    
 Instea@@ d, I was a very strong woman in love with a deep@@ ly tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed man, and I was the only person on Earth who could help Con@@ or face his de@@ mon@@ s.    
 The other question everybody as@@ ks is, why doesn't she just lea@@ ve@@ ?    
 Why didn't I walk out@@ ? I could have left any time.    
 To me, this is the sa@@ dd@@ est and most pain@@ ful question that people as@@ k, because we victim@@ s know something you usually don@@ '@@ t@@ : It's incredi@@ b@@ ly danger@@ ous to leave an ab@@ us@@ er.    
 Because the fin@@ al step in the domestic violence patter@@ n is kill her@@ .    
 O@@ ver 7@@ 0 percent of domestic violence m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers happen after the vic@@ ti@@ m has ended the relationshi@@ p, after she's gotten out, because then the ab@@ us@@ er has nothing left to lo@@ se.    
 O@@ ther out@@ comes inclu@@ de long@@ -@@ term st@@ al@@ king, even after the ab@@ us@@ er re@@ mar@@ ri@@ es@@ ; den@@ ial of fin@@ anci@@ al resour@@ c@@ es@@ ; and man@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ tion of the family cour@@ t system to terri@@ fy the vic@@ ti@@ m and her children, who are re@@ g@@ ul@@ arly forced by family cour@@ t judg@@ es to spend un@@ super@@ vis@@ ed time with the man who be@@ at their mother@@ .    
 And still we as@@ k, why doesn't she just lea@@ ve@@ ?    
 I was able to lea@@ ve, because of one fin@@ al, sa@@ di@@ sti@@ c be@@ ating that bro@@ ke through my den@@ i@@ al.    
 I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him.    
 So I bro@@ ke the sil@@ ence.    
 I told every@@ one@@ : the polic@@ e, my neighbor@@ s, my friends and family, to@@ tal strang@@ ers, and I'm here today because you all helped me.    
 We t@@ end to ster@@ e@@ o@@ type victim@@ s as g@@ ris@@ ly head@@ lin@@ es, self-@@ des@@ truc@@ tive wom@@ en, da@@ mag@@ ed goo@@ ds.    
 The ques@@ tion, "@@ Why does she sta@@ y@@ ?"    
 is code for some people for@@ , "@@ It's her fa@@ ult for sta@@ y@@ ing@@ ," as if victim@@ s in@@ ten@@ tion@@ ally choose to f@@ all in love with men in@@ t@@ ent up@@ on des@@ tro@@ ying us.    
 But since publi@@ sh@@ ing "@@ C@@ ra@@ z@@ y L@@ o@@ ve@@ ," I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out, who learned an inv@@ al@@ u@@ able life less@@ on from what happen@@ ed, and who re@@ built lives -- jo@@ you@@ s, happy lives -- as emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es, wi@@ ves and mother@@ s, lives completely free of viol@@ ence, like me.    
 Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence vic@@ ti@@ m and a typical domestic violence survi@@ v@@ or.    
 I re@@ married a kind and g@@ ent@@ le man, and we have those three kid@@ s.    
 I have that black lab@@ , and I have that min@@ i@@ v@@ an.    
 What I will never have again, ever@@ , is a lo@@ ad@@ ed gu@@ n hel@@ d to my head by someone who says that he lo@@ ves me.    
 Ri@@ ght now, maybe you're thinking, "@@ W@@ ow, this is fascin@@ at@@ ing@@ ," or, "@@ W@@ ow, how stu@@ pi@@ d was she@@ ," but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.    
 I prom@@ ise you there are several people list@@ ening to me right now who are cur@@ ren@@ tly being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ us@@ ers them@@ selves.    
 A@@ b@@ use could be affec@@ ting your daugh@@ ter, your sist@@ er, your best friend right now.    
 I was able to end my own crazy love story by brea@@ king the sil@@ ence.    
 I'm still brea@@ king the sil@@ ence today.    
 It's my way of hel@@ ping other victim@@ s, and it's my fin@@ al re@@ qu@@ est of you.    
 T@@ al@@ k about what you heard here.    
 A@@ b@@ use th@@ ri@@ ves only in sil@@ ence.    
 You have the power to end domestic violence simply by sh@@ ining a s@@ pot@@ light on it.    
 We victim@@ s need every@@ one.    
 We need every one of you to understand the secre@@ ts of domestic viol@@ ence.    
 S@@ how ab@@ use the light of day by talking about it with your children, your co@@ work@@ ers, your friends and famil@@ y.    
 Re@@ ca@@ st survi@@ v@@ ors as wonder@@ ful, lo@@ v@@ able people with full fu@@ ture@@ s.    
 R@@ ec@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ ize the ear@@ ly sig@@ ns of violence and consci@@ enti@@ ously inter@@ ven@@ e, de@@ es@@ cal@@ ate it, show victim@@ s a sa@@ fe way out.    
 To@@ ge@@ ther we can make our be@@ ds, our d@@ inner tab@@ les and our famili@@ es the sa@@ fe and pe@@ ace@@ ful o@@ as@@ es they should be.    
 Thank you.    
 H@@ i@@ . My name is C@@ am@@ er@@ on R@@ us@@ sel@@ l@@ , and for the last little whi@@ le, I've been a model@@ .    
 A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally, for 10 years.    
 And I feel like there's an un@@ comfor@@ table ten@@ sion in the room right now because I should not have wor@@ n this dres@@ s. So luck@@ il@@ y, I brought an out@@ fit change.    
 This is the first out@@ fit change on the TED st@@ age, so you guys are pretty luck@@ y to wit@@ ness it, I thin@@ k.    
 If some of the women were really hor@@ ri@@ fied when I came out, you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on T@@ wit@@ ter.    
  I'd also no@@ te that I'm quite pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed to be able to trans@@ form what you think of me in a very bri@@ ef 10 secon@@ ds.    
 Not everybody gets to do that.    
 These he@@ el@@ s are very un@@ comfor@@ table, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.    
 The worst part is putting this s@@ we@@ at@@ er over my hea@@ d, because that's when you'll all la@@ u@@ gh at me, so don't do anything while it's over my hea@@ d.    
 All right.    
 So, why did I do that?    
 That was aw@@ k@@ war@@ d. Well -- H@@ op@@ e@@ fully not as aw@@ k@@ ward as that pic@@ ture.    
 I@@ mage is power@@ ful, but al@@ so, image is super@@ fic@@ i@@ al.    
 I just totally trans@@ for@@ med what you thought of me, in six secon@@ ds.    
 And in this pic@@ ture, I had actually never had a bo@@ y@@ friend in real life.    
 I was totally un@@ comfor@@ table, and the photograph@@ er was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that gu@@ y's ha@@ ir@@ .    
 And of course, bar@@ r@@ ing surg@@ er@@ y, or the fa@@ ke t@@ an that I got two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to trans@@ form how we loo@@ k, and how we loo@@ k, though it is super@@ fic@@ ial and im@@ mu@@ table, has a huge impact on our lives.    
 So today, for me, being fear@@ less means being hon@@ es@@ t.    
 And I am on this st@@ age because I am a model@@ .    
 I am on this st@@ age because I am a pret@@ ty, white wom@@ an, and in my indu@@ str@@ y, we call that a sex@@ y girl@@ .    
 I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but with an hon@@ est tw@@ ist@@ .    
 So the first question is, how do you become a model@@ ?    
 I always just say, "O@@ h, I was s@@ cou@@ te@@ d@@ ," but that means no@@ thing. The real way that I became a model is I w@@ on a genetic lo@@ t@@ ter@@ y, and I am the reci@@ pi@@ ent of a leg@@ ac@@ y, and maybe you're wonder@@ ing what is a leg@@ ac@@ y.    
 Well, for the past few cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es we have defin@@ ed beau@@ ty not just as health and you@@ th and sy@@ m@@ me@@ try that we're bio@@ log@@ ically progr@@ am@@ med to ad@@ mi@@ re, but also as t@@ all, s@@ l@@ end@@ er figu@@ re@@ s, and femin@@ in@@ ity and white sk@@ in.    
 And this is a leg@@ ac@@ y that was built for me, and it's a leg@@ ac@@ y that I've been ca@@ sh@@ ing out on.    
 And I know there are people in the audi@@ ence who are sk@@ ep@@ tical at this poin@@ t, and maybe there are some fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ as who are like, "@@ W@@ a@@ it. Na@@ om@@ i@@ . T@@ y@@ ra@@ . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ all@@ s. Li@@ u W@@ en@@ ."    
 And fir@@ st, I comm@@ end you on your model knowle@@ dg@@ e. V@@ ery imp@@ res@@ si@@ ve.    
   But un@@ fortun@@ ately, I have to infor@@ m you that in 200@@ 7@@ , a very inspi@@ red N@@ Y@@ U P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . stud@@ ent coun@@ ted all the model@@ s on the run@@ way, every single one that was hi@@ re@@ d, and of the 6@@ 7@@ 7 model@@ s that were hi@@ re@@ d, only 2@@ 7@@ , or less than four perc@@ ent, were n@@ on-@@ wh@@ it@@ e.    
 The next question people always ask is, "@@ Can I be a model when I grow up@@ ?"    
 And the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in char@@ ge of that@@ ."    
 But the second answ@@ er, and what I really want to say to these little girls is, "@@ Wh@@ y? You know@@ ? You can be any@@ thing.    
 You could be the Presid@@ ent of the United St@@ ates, or the invent@@ or of the next Inter@@ ne@@ t, or a n@@ in@@ j@@ a car@@ di@@ o@@ th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ on po@@ e@@ t, which would be aw@@ es@@ om@@ e, because you'd be the first one@@ ."    
   I@@ f@@ , after this amazing li@@ st, they still are like, "@@ No, no@@ , C@@ am@@ er@@ on, I want to be a model@@ ," well, then I say, "@@ B@@ e my b@@ os@@ s."    
 Because I'm not in char@@ ge of any@@ thing, and you could be the ed@@ it@@ or in chi@@ ef of American V@@ o@@ gu@@ e or the C@@ E@@ O of H@@ &@@ M@@ , or the next Ste@@ ven M@@ e@@ is@@ el@@ .    
 S@@ a@@ ying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to sa@@ ying that you want to win the P@@ ow@@ er@@ b@@ all when you grow up.    
 It's out of your contro@@ l@@ , and it's aw@@ es@@ om@@ e, and it's not a care@@ er pa@@ th.    
 I will de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate for you now 10 years of ac@@ cu@@ mul@@ ated model knowle@@ dg@@ e, because un@@ like car@@ di@@ o@@ th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ on@@ s, it can just be di@@ sti@@ l@@ led right now.    
 So, if the photograph@@ er is right there, the light is right there, like a n@@ ice H@@ M@@ I@@ , and the cli@@ ent says, "@@ We want a walking sho@@ t@@ ," this le@@ g goes fir@@ st, n@@ ice and long@@ , this ar@@ m goes back, this ar@@ m goes for@@ war@@ d, the head is at three quar@@ ters, and you just go back and for@@ th, just do that, and then you look back at your imagin@@ ary friends, 3@@ 00@@ , 4@@ 00@@ , 500 times. It will look something like this.     
 H@@ op@@ e@@ fully less aw@@ k@@ ward than that one in the m@@ idd@@ le.    
 That was -- I don't know what happened there.    
 Un@@ fortun@@ ately, after you've gone to school, and you have a r@@ é@@ sum@@ é and you've done a few job@@ s, you can't say anything any@@ mo@@ re, so if you say you want to be the Presid@@ ent of the United St@@ ates, but your r@@ é@@ sum@@ é read@@ s, "@@ Un@@ der@@ wear Mo@@ del@@ : 10 year@@ s@@ ," people give you a fun@@ ny loo@@ k.    
 The next question is, "@@ Do they re@@ tou@@ ch all the pho@@ t@@ os@@ ?"    
 And yea@@ h, they pretty much re@@ tou@@ ch all the photo@@ s, but that is only a small comp@@ on@@ ent of what's happen@@ ing.    
 This picture is the very first picture that I ever too@@ k, and it's also the very first time that I had wor@@ n a bi@@ kin@@ i@@ , and I didn't even have my peri@@ od ye@@ t.    
 I know we're getting person@@ al, but I was a young girl@@ .    
 This is what I looked like with my grand@@ m@@ a just a few months earli@@ er.    
 Here's me on the same day as this sh@@ oo@@ t.    
 My friend got to com@@ e.    
 Here's me at a s@@ lu@@ mb@@ er par@@ ty a few days before I sho@@ t F@@ ren@@ ch V@@ o@@ gu@@ e.    
 Here's me on the so@@ cc@@ er team and in V M@@ ag@@ az@@ ine.    
 And here's me today.    
 And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me.    
 They are construc@@ tions, and they are construc@@ tions by a group of prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als, by ha@@ ir@@ st@@ y@@ li@@ sts and ma@@ ke@@ up arti@@ sts and photograph@@ ers and st@@ y@@ li@@ sts and all of their as@@ si@@ stan@@ ts and pre@@ -@@ produc@@ tion and po@@ st@@ -@@ produc@@ tion, and they build this. That's not me.    
 Oka@@ y, so the next question people always ask me is, "@@ Do you get free stuff@@ ?"    
 I do have too many 8@@ -@@ in@@ ch he@@ el@@ s which I never get to we@@ ar, excep@@ t for earli@@ er, but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk ab@@ out.    
 I grew up in C@@ am@@ bri@@ dg@@ e, and one time I went into a store and I for@@ got my money and they gave me the dres@@ s for fre@@ e.    
 When I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er, I was dri@@ ving with my friend who was an aw@@ ful dri@@ ver and she r@@ an a red and of course, we got pul@@ led over@@ , and all it took was a "@@ S@@ or@@ r@@ y, offic@@ er@@ ," and we were on our way.    
 And I got these free things because of how I loo@@ k, not who I am, and there are people pa@@ ying a cost for how they look and not who they are.    
 I live in New Yor@@ k, and last year, of the 1@@ 4@@ 0@@ ,000 te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers that were stopped and fri@@ s@@ ke@@ d, 8@@ 6@@ % of them were black and L@@ at@@ in@@ o, and most of them were young m@@ en.    
 And there are only 1@@ 7@@ 7@@ ,000 young black and L@@ at@@ in@@ o men in New Yor@@ k, so for them, it's not a question of, "@@ W@@ ill I get stop@@ pe@@ d@@ ?"    
 but "@@ How many times will I get stop@@ pe@@ d? When will I get stop@@ pe@@ d@@ ?"    
 When I was rese@@ arch@@ ing this tal@@ k, I found out that of the 1@@ 3@@ -year-old girls in the United St@@ ates, 5@@ 3@@ % don't like their bo@@ di@@ es, and that number goes to 7@@ 8@@ % by the time that they're 1@@ 7@@ .    
 So, the last question people ask me is, "What is it like to be a model@@ ?"    
 And I think the answer that they're looking for is, "@@ If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er and you have sh@@ ini@@ er ha@@ ir@@ , you will be so happy and f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous@@ ."    
 And when we're back@@ st@@ age, we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that.    
 We say, "@@ It's really amazing to tra@@ vel@@ , and it's amazing to get to work with creativ@@ e, inspi@@ re@@ d, pas@@ sion@@ ate people@@ ."    
 And those things are tru@@ e, but they're only one half of the story, because the thing that we never say on camer@@ a, that I have never said on camer@@ a, is, "I am in@@ se@@ cu@@ re@@ ."    
 And I'm in@@ se@@ cu@@ re because I have to think about what I look like every day.    
 And if you ever are wonder@@ ing, "@@ If I have thin@@ ner thi@@ gh@@ s and sh@@ ini@@ er ha@@ ir@@ , will I be happ@@ i@@ er@@ ?"    
 you just need to meet a group of model@@ s, because they have the thin@@ n@@ est thi@@ gh@@ s, the sh@@ ini@@ est ha@@ ir and the co@@ ol@@ est clo@@ th@@ es, and they're the most physic@@ ally in@@ se@@ cu@@ re women probably on the planet.    
 When I was writing this tal@@ k, I found it very difficult to stri@@ ke an hon@@ est bal@@ anc@@ e, because on the one han@@ d, I felt very un@@ comfor@@ table to come out here and say, "@@ L@@ oo@@ k I've recei@@ ved all these bene@@ f@@ its from a dec@@ k st@@ ac@@ ked in my favor@@ ," and it also felt really un@@ comfor@@ table to follow that up with@@ , "@@ and it doesn't always make me happ@@ y."    
 But mo@@ st@@ ly it was difficult to un@@ p@@ ack a leg@@ ac@@ y of gen@@ der and rac@@ ial op@@ pres@@ sion when I am one of the biggest bene@@ fic@@ i@@ ari@@ es.    
 But I'm also happy and hon@@ ore@@ d to be up here and I think that it's great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had pas@@ sed and I'd had more ag@@ ency in my care@@ er, because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job@@ , or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I pa@@ id for colle@@ g@@ e, which seems so important right now.    
 If there's a ta@@ k@@ ea@@ way to this tal@@ k, I hope it's that we all feel more comfor@@ table ac@@ knowle@@ dg@@ ing the power of image in our perc@@ ei@@ ved success@@ es and our perc@@ ei@@ ved fail@@ u@@ re@@ s.    
 Thank you.     
 P@@ ho@@ to@@ graph@@ y has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camer@@ a, but today I want to share with you the 15 most tre@@ as@@ u@@ red photos of min@@ e, and I didn't take any of them.    
 There were no art direc@@ tor@@ s, no st@@ y@@ list@@ s, no chance for re@@ sh@@ oo@@ ts, not even any re@@ g@@ ard for light@@ ing.    
 In fact, most of them were taken by ran@@ dom tou@@ ri@@ st@@ s.    
 My story beg@@ ins when I was in New York C@@ ity for a spea@@ king en@@ ga@@ ge@@ ment, and my wi@@ fe took this picture of me hol@@ ding my daughter on her first bir@@ th@@ day. We're on the cor@@ ner of 5@@ 7@@ th and 5@@ th.    
 We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same pic@@ ture.    
 Well you can see where this is go@@ ing.    
 A@@ p@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing my daugh@@ ter@@ 's third bir@@ th@@ day, my wi@@ fe said, "H@@ e@@ y, why don't you take S@@ ab@@ in@@ a back to New York and make it a father@@ -@@ daughter tri@@ p, and contin@@ ue the r@@ itu@@ al@@ ?"    
 This is when we started asking pas@@ sing tou@@ ri@@ sts to take the pic@@ ture.    
 the g@@ es@@ ture is of han@@ ding your camera to a to@@ tal strang@@ er.    
 No one's ever ref@@ us@@ ed, and luck@@ ily no one's ever run off with our camer@@ a.    
 B@@ ack then, we had no idea how much this tri@@ p would change our lives.    
 It's really become s@@ ac@@ red to us.    
 This one was taken just weeks after 9@@ /@@ 1@@ 1, and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a fi@@ ve@@ -year-old could under@@ stan@@ d.    
 So these photos are far more than pro@@ x@@ ies for a single mom@@ ent, or even a speci@@ fic tri@@ p.    
 They're also ways for us to free@@ ze time for one week in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er and ref@@ le@@ ct on our times and how we change from year to year, and not just physic@@ ally, but in every way.    
 Because while we take the same photo@@ , our perspec@@ tiv@@ es chang@@ e, and she reach@@ es new mil@@ est@@ on@@ es, and I get to see life through her ey@@ es, and how she interac@@ ts with and se@@ es every@@ thing.    
 This very foc@@ used time we get to spend together is something we ch@@ er@@ ish and an@@ tici@@ p@@ ate the entire year.    
 R@@ ec@@ ent@@ ly, on one tri@@ p, we were wal@@ king, and she stop@@ s de@@ ad in her trac@@ ks, and she poin@@ ts to a red aw@@ ning of the dol@@ l store that she loved when she was little on our earli@@ er tri@@ p@@ s.    
 And she descri@@ b@@ es to me the feeling she felt as a fi@@ ve@@ -year-old standing in that ex@@ act spo@@ t.    
 She said she rememb@@ ers her heart bur@@ sting out of her ch@@ est when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earli@@ er.    
 And now what she's looking at in New York are colle@@ g@@ es, because she's de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to go to school in New Yor@@ k.    
 And it hit me@@ : One of the most important things we all make are memor@@ ies.    
 So I want to share the idea of taking an ac@@ tive ro@@ le in conscious@@ ly creating memor@@ ies.    
 I don't know about you, but as@@ ide from these 15 sho@@ ts, I'm not in many of the family photo@@ s.    
 I'm always the one taking the pic@@ ture.    
 So I want to en@@ courage everyone today to get in the sho@@ t, and don't h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to go up to someone and as@@ k, "@@ W@@ ill you take our pic@@ ture@@ ?"    
 Thank you.     
 I would like to talk to you about a very speci@@ al group of anim@@ als.    
 There are 10@@ ,000 species of bir@@ ds in the world.    
 V@@ ul@@ tures are am@@ ong@@ st the most thre@@ at@@ ened group of bir@@ ds.    
 When you see a vul@@ ture like this, the first thing that comes to your mind is, these are dis@@ gu@@ st@@ ing, u@@ g@@ ly, gre@@ e@@ dy creatu@@ res that are just after your fl@@ es@@ h, as@@ soci@@ ated with poli@@ tici@@ an@@ s. I want to change that perc@@ ep@@ tion. I want to change those feel@@ ings you have for these bir@@ ds, because they need our sy@@ mp@@ a@@ th@@ y. They really do. And I'll tell you wh@@ y.    
 Fir@@ st of all, why do they have such a bad pres@@ s?    
 When Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ win went across the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic in 1@@ 8@@ 3@@ 2 on the Be@@ ag@@ le, he saw the tur@@ key vul@@ ture, and he said, "@@ These are dis@@ gu@@ sting bir@@ ds with bal@@ d sc@@ ar@@ let head@@ s that are for@@ med to re@@ vel in pu@@ tri@@ d@@ it@@ y." You could not get a worse in@@ sul@@ t, and that from Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in. You know, he changed his mind when he came back, and I'll tell you wh@@ y.    
 The@@ y@@ 've also be as@@ soci@@ ated with D@@ is@@ ney — — person@@ i@@ fied as go@@ of@@ y, du@@ mb@@ , stu@@ pi@@ d charac@@ ters.    
 M@@ or@@ e rec@@ ent@@ ly, if you've been follow@@ ing the Ken@@ y@@ an pres@@ s — — these are the at@@ tribu@@ tes that they as@@ soci@@ ated the Ken@@ y@@ an M@@ P@@ s with@@ . But I want to challenge that.    
 I want to challenge that. Do you know wh@@ y?    
 Because M@@ P@@ s do not keep the environment cle@@ an. M@@ P@@ s do not help to pre@@ v@@ ent the sp@@ read of diseas@@ es.    
 They are har@@ d@@ ly mon@@ o@@ gam@@ ous. They are far from being ex@@ tin@@ c@@ t. And, my favorite is, vul@@ tures are better loo@@ king. So there's two types of vul@@ tures in this planet.    
 There are the New World vul@@ tures that are main@@ ly found in the Ameri@@ ca@@ s, like the con@@ d@@ ors and the car@@ ac@@ ar@@ as, and then the O@@ ld World vul@@ tures, where we have 1@@ 6 speci@@ es. F@@ rom these 1@@ 6@@ , 1@@ 1 of them are fac@@ ing a high ris@@ k of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion.    
 So why are vul@@ tures import@@ ant@@ ? Fir@@ st of all, they provid@@ e v@@ ital ec@@ o@@ logical servic@@ es. They clean up.    
 They're our natural gar@@ b@@ age collec@@ tor@@ s.    
 They clean up car@@ cas@@ ses right to the b@@ one.    
 They help to kill all the bacteri@@ a. They help ab@@ sor@@ b an@@ th@@ ra@@ x that would other@@ w@@ ise sp@@ read and cause huge liv@@ es@@ to@@ ck lo@@ s@@ ses and diseas@@ es in other anim@@ als.    
 R@@ ec@@ ent stu@@ dies have shown that in are@@ as where there are no vul@@ tures, car@@ cas@@ ses take up to three to four times to de@@ comp@@ os@@ e, and this has huge r@@ am@@ i@@ fi@@ cations for the sp@@ read of diseas@@ es.    
 V@@ ul@@ tures also have trem@@ end@@ ous hi@@ stor@@ ical signific@@ anc@@ e.    
 They have been as@@ soci@@ ated in ancient Egyp@@ ti@@ an cul@@ ture.    
 N@@ e@@ k@@ h@@ be@@ t was the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the prote@@ c@@ tor and the mother@@ h@@ oo@@ d, and together with the co@@ bra@@ , sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ zed the un@@ ity between U@@ pp@@ er and L@@ ow@@ er Egyp@@ t.    
 In H@@ in@@ d@@ u my@@ tho@@ log@@ y, J@@ at@@ ay@@ u was the vul@@ ture go@@ d, and he ris@@ ked his life in order to save the go@@ dd@@ ess S@@ it@@ a In T@@ i@@ bet@@ an cul@@ ture, they are perfor@@ m@@ ing very important sk@@ y bu@@ ri@@ als. In places like T@@ i@@ be@@ t, there are no places to bur@@ y the dea@@ d, or w@@ ood to cre@@ m@@ ate them, so these vul@@ tures provid@@ e a natural disp@@ os@@ al system.    
 So what is the problem with vul@@ tu@@ res@@ ?    
 We have eight species of vul@@ tures that oc@@ cu@@ r in Ken@@ y@@ a, of which six are high@@ ly thre@@ at@@ ened with ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion.    
 The reason is that they're getting po@@ is@@ on@@ ed, and the reason that they're getting po@@ is@@ on@@ ed is because there's human@@ -@@ w@@ il@@ d@@ life conf@@ lic@@ ts. The pa@@ stor@@ al communities are using this po@@ is@@ on to target pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s, and in re@@ tur@@ n, the vul@@ tures are f@@ all@@ ing vic@@ ti@@ m to this.    
 In South A@@ si@@ a, in countries like Indi@@ a and P@@ ak@@ i@@ stan@@ , four species of vul@@ tures are list@@ ed as cri@@ tically end@@ ang@@ er@@ ed, which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go ex@@ tin@@ c@@ t, and the reason is because they are f@@ all@@ ing pre@@ y by con@@ sum@@ ing liv@@ es@@ to@@ ck that has been tre@@ ated with a pain@@ kill@@ ing d@@ ru@@ g like D@@ ic@@ lo@@ f@@ en@@ ac@@ .    
 This d@@ ru@@ g has now been ban@@ ned for ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ary use in Indi@@ a, and they have taken a stan@@ d.    
 Because there are no vul@@ tures, there's been a sp@@ read in the numb@@ ers of fer@@ al do@@ g@@ s at car@@ ca@@ ss du@@ m@@ p sit@@ es, and when you have fer@@ al do@@ g@@ s, you have a huge time b@@ om@@ b of r@@ ab@@ ies. The number of ca@@ ses of r@@ ab@@ ies has increas@@ ed trem@@ end@@ ously in Indi@@ a.    
 Ken@@ y@@ a is going to have one of the larg@@ est w@@ ind far@@ ms in Afri@@ ca@@ : 3@@ 5@@ 3 w@@ ind tur@@ b@@ ines are going to be up at L@@ a@@ ke T@@ ur@@ k@@ an@@ a.    
 I am not against w@@ ind energ@@ y, but we need to work with the govern@@ ment@@ s, because w@@ ind tur@@ b@@ ines do this to bir@@ ds. They sli@@ ce them in hal@@ f@@ .    
 They are bir@@ d-@@ bl@@ ending mach@@ in@@ es.    
 In W@@ est Afri@@ ca, there's a hor@@ ri@@ fic tra@@ de of de@@ ad vul@@ tures to ser@@ ve the wit@@ ch@@ cra@@ ft and the fe@@ tis@@ h marke@@ t.    
 So what's being don@@ e? Well, we're con@@ duc@@ ting research on these bir@@ ds. We're putting tran@@ sm@@ it@@ ters on them.    
 We're trying to de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine their basic ec@@ o@@ log@@ y, and see where they go.    
 We can see that they tra@@ vel different countri@@ es, so if you foc@@ us on a problem lo@@ call@@ y, it's not going to help you.    
 We need to work with govern@@ ments in re@@ gi@@ on@@ al level@@ s.    
 We're working with local communi@@ ties.    
 We're talking to them about app@@ reci@@ ating vul@@ tures, about the need from within to app@@ reci@@ ate these wonder@@ ful creatu@@ res and the services that they provid@@ e.    
 How can you hel@@ p@@ ? You can become ac@@ tive, make no@@ is@@ e. You can write a let@@ ter to your government and tell them that we need to foc@@ us on these very mis@@ underst@@ ood creatu@@ re@@ s. V@@ ol@@ unte@@ er your time to sp@@ read the wor@@ d. S@@ pre@@ ad the wor@@ d.    
 When you walk out of this room@@ , you will be infor@@ med about vul@@ tures, but speak to your famili@@ es, to your children, to your neighbor@@ s about vul@@ ture@@ s.    
 They are very gr@@ ace@@ ful. Ch@@ ar@@ les D@@ ar@@ win said he changed his mind because he wat@@ ched them f@@ ly eff@@ ort@@ less@@ ly without energy in the sk@@ ies.    
 Ken@@ y@@ a, this world, will be much po@@ ore@@ r Thank you very much.     
 Every@@ thing I do, and everything I do prof@@ es@@ sion@@ ally -- my life -- has been sha@@ ped by seven years of work as a young man in Afri@@ ca@@ .    
 F@@ rom 19@@ 7@@ 1 to 19@@ 7@@ 7 -- I look youn@@ g, but I'm not — -- I worked in Z@@ ambi@@ a, Ken@@ y@@ a, I@@ vor@@ y Co@@ a@@ st, Al@@ g@@ eri@@ a, S@@ om@@ ali@@ a, in projec@@ ts of techni@@ cal co@@ oper@@ ation with Afri@@ can countri@@ es.    
 I worked for an Ital@@ ian N@@ G@@ O@@ , and every single project that we set up in Afri@@ c@@ a fa@@ i@@ le@@ d.    
 And I was di@@ stra@@ u@@ ght.    
 I thought, age 2@@ 1, that we Ital@@ i@@ ans were good people and we were doing good work in Afri@@ ca@@ .    
 Instea@@ d, everything we tou@@ ched we k@@ il@@ le@@ d.    
 Our first projec@@ t, the one that has inspi@@ red my first book, "@@ Ri@@ pp@@ les from the Z@@ am@@ be@@ z@@ i@@ ," was a project where we Ital@@ i@@ ans decided to teach Z@@ ambi@@ an people how to grow foo@@ d.    
 So we arri@@ ved there with Ital@@ ian see@@ ds in sou@@ ther@@ n Z@@ ambi@@ a in this absolutely mag@@ nific@@ ent val@@ le@@ y going down to the Z@@ am@@ be@@ z@@ i Ri@@ ver, and we taught the local people how to grow Ital@@ ian tom@@ at@@ o@@ es and z@@ uc@@ ch@@ in@@ i and ...    
 And of course the local people had absolutely no inter@@ est in doing that, so we pa@@ id them to come and work, and sometimes they would show up. And we were ama@@ zed that the local people, in such a fer@@ ti@@ le val@@ le@@ y, would not have any ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture.    
 But instead of asking them how come they were not growing any@@ thing, we simply said, "@@ Thank G@@ od we're her@@ e." "@@ Just in the n@@ ic@@ k of time to save the Z@@ ambi@@ an people from star@@ va@@ tion@@ ."    
 And of course, everything in Afri@@ c@@ a grew beauti@@ ful@@ ly.    
 We had these mag@@ nific@@ ent tom@@ at@@ o@@ es. In Ital@@ y, a tom@@ a@@ to would grow to this si@@ z@@ e. In Z@@ ambi@@ a, to this si@@ z@@ e.    
 And we could not believ@@ e, and we were telling the Z@@ ambi@@ an@@ s, "@@ L@@ oo@@ k how easy ag@@ ri@@ culture is@@ ."    
 When the tom@@ at@@ o@@ es were n@@ ice and ri@@ pe and re@@ d, over@@ night, some 2@@ 00 hi@@ p@@ po@@ s came out from the ri@@ ver and they ate every@@ thing. And we said to the Z@@ ambi@@ an@@ s, "@@ My Go@@ d, the hi@@ pp@@ os@@ !@@ "    
 And the Z@@ ambi@@ ans said, "@@ Y@@ es, that's why we have no ag@@ ri@@ culture her@@ e." "@@ Why didn't you tell us@@ ?@@ "@@ "@@ You never as@@ ke@@ d@@ ."    
 I thought it was only us Ital@@ i@@ ans bl@@ under@@ ing around Afri@@ ca, but then I saw what the Americ@@ ans were do@@ ing, what the Eng@@ lish were do@@ ing, what the F@@ ren@@ ch were do@@ ing, and after seeing what they were do@@ ing, I became quite p@@ rou@@ d of our project in Z@@ ambi@@ a.    
 Be@@ cause, you see, at least we f@@ ed the hi@@ p@@ po@@ s.    
 You should see the ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish — -- You should see the ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish that we have b@@ es@@ tow@@ ed on un@@ s@@ us@@ pec@@ ting Afri@@ can people.    
 You want to read the book, read "D@@ ea@@ d A@@ id@@ ," by D@@ am@@ b@@ is@@ a Mo@@ y@@ o, The book was publi@@ sh@@ ed in 200@@ 9@@ .    
 We W@@ es@@ ter@@ n don@@ or countries have given the Afri@@ can contin@@ ent two tr@@ illion American dollars in the last 50 years.    
 I'm not going to tell you the da@@ mage that that money has don@@ e.    
 Just go and read her boo@@ k.    
 R@@ ea@@ d it from an Afri@@ can wom@@ an, the da@@ mage that we have don@@ e.    
 We W@@ es@@ ter@@ n people are im@@ peri@@ al@@ ist@@ , col@@ on@@ i@@ al@@ ist mis@@ sion@@ ari@@ es, and there are only two ways we deal with people@@ : We ei@@ ther pat@@ ron@@ ize them, or we are pat@@ er@@ nal@@ is@@ tic.    
 The two words come from the L@@ ati@@ n roo@@ t "@@ pat@@ er@@ ," which means "@@ father@@ ."    
 But they mean two different things.    
 P@@ at@@ er@@ nal@@ is@@ tic@@ , I tre@@ at anybody from a different culture as if they were my children@@ . "I love you so mu@@ ch@@ ."    
 P@@ at@@ ron@@ iz@@ ing, I tre@@ at everybody from another culture as if they were my ser@@ v@@ an@@ ts.    
 That's why the white people in Afri@@ c@@ a are called "@@ b@@ wan@@ a@@ ," b@@ os@@ s.    
 I was given a sla@@ p in the face reading a book, "@@ S@@ m@@ all is B@@ ea@@ u@@ ti@@ ful@@ ," writ@@ ten by S@@ ch@@ u@@ mach@@ er, who said, abo@@ ve all in econom@@ ic develop@@ ment, if people do not w@@ ish to be hel@@ pe@@ d, leave them al@@ one.    
 This should be the first prin@@ ci@@ ple of a@@ id@@ .    
 The first prin@@ ci@@ ple of a@@ id is res@@ pec@@ t.    
 This morning, the g@@ ent@@ le@@ man who op@@ ened this conf@@ er@@ ence la@@ y a s@@ tic@@ k on the flo@@ or, and said, "@@ Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not ne@@ o@@ col@@ on@@ i@@ al@@ ?"    
 I decided when I was 2@@ 7 years old to only respon@@ d to people, and I invent@@ ed a system called En@@ ter@@ pri@@ se F@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ation, where you never initi@@ ate any@@ thing, you never motiv@@ ate any@@ bod@@ y, but you become a ser@@ v@@ ant of the local pas@@ sion, the ser@@ v@@ ant of local people who have a dream to become a better pers@@ on.    
 So what you do -- you sh@@ ut up.    
 You never arri@@ ve in a community with any ide@@ as, and you s@@ it with the local people.    
 We don't work from offic@@ es.    
 We meet at the ca@@ f@@ e. We meet at the pub@@ .    
 We have zer@@ o in@@ fra@@ struc@@ ture.    
 And what we do, we become friends, and we find out what that person wan@@ ts to do.    
 The most important thing is pas@@ sion.    
 You can give somebody an idea@@ .    
 If that person doesn't want to do it, what are you going to do@@ ?    
 The passion that the person has for her own grow@@ th is the most important thing.    
 The passion that that man has for his own person@@ al grow@@ th is the most important thing.    
 And then we help them to go and find the knowle@@ dg@@ e, because no@@ body in the world can succ@@ e@@ ed al@@ one.    
 The person with the idea may not have the knowle@@ dg@@ e, but the knowledge is avail@@ able.    
 So years and years ago, I had this idea@@ : Why don't w@@ e, for on@@ ce, instead of arri@@ ving in the community to tell people what to do, why don@@ '@@ t, for on@@ ce, list@@ en to them@@ ? But not in community me@@ et@@ ings.    
 L@@ et me tell you a secre@@ t.    
 There is a problem with community me@@ et@@ ings.    
 En@@ tre@@ prene@@ ur@@ s never com@@ e, and they never tell you, in a public me@@ et@@ ing, what they want to do with their own mone@@ y, what opportunity they have identi@@ fi@@ ed.    
 So plan@@ ning has this bl@@ ind spo@@ t.    
 The smar@@ test people in your community you don't even know, because they don't come to your public me@@ et@@ ings.    
 What we do, we work one@@ -@@ on-@@ one, and to work one@@ -@@ on-@@ one, you have to create a social in@@ fra@@ struc@@ ture that doesn't exist@@ .    
 You have to create a new prof@@ es@@ sion.    
 The prof@@ es@@ sion is the family doctor of enter@@ pri@@ se, the family doctor of busin@@ ess, who s@@ its with you in your hous@@ e, at your k@@ it@@ ch@@ en table, at the ca@@ f@@ e, and hel@@ ps you find the resour@@ ces to trans@@ form your passion into a way to make a liv@@ ing.    
 I started this as a tr@@ y@@ out in E@@ s@@ per@@ anc@@ e, in W@@ es@@ ter@@ n A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a.    
 I was a doing a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . at the time, trying to go away from this pat@@ ron@@ izing bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it that we arri@@ ve and tell you what to do.    
 And so what I did in E@@ s@@ per@@ ance that first year was to just walk the stre@@ et@@ s, and in three days I had my first cli@@ ent, and I helped this first guy who was s@@ mo@@ king fish from a gar@@ age, was a Ma@@ or@@ i gu@@ y, and I helped him to sel@@ l to the re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in P@@ er@@ th, to get organ@@ iz@@ ed, and then the fish@@ er@@ men came to me to say, "@@ You the guy who helped Ma@@ ori@@ ? Can you help us@@ ?"    
 And I helped these five fish@@ er@@ men to work together and get this beautiful tun@@ a not to the can@@ n@@ ery in Al@@ b@@ any for 6@@ 0 c@@ ents a ki@@ lo@@ , but we found a way to take the fish for s@@ us@@ h@@ i to J@@ ap@@ an for 15 dollars a ki@@ lo@@ , and the far@@ m@@ ers came to talk to me, said, "H@@ e@@ y, you helped them. Can you help us@@ ?"    
 In a year, I had 2@@ 7 projec@@ ts going on, and the government came to see me to say, "@@ How can you do that?    
 How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very diffic@@ ul@@ t.    
 I sh@@ ut up, and list@@ en to them@@ ." So — — So the government says, "@@ Do it again@@ ." We've done it in 3@@ 00 communities around the world.    
 We have helped to start 4@@ 0@@ ,000 busin@@ ess@@ es.    
 There is a new generation of entrepreneur@@ s who are d@@ ying of sol@@ itu@@ de.    
 Pe@@ ter D@@ r@@ uck@@ er, one of the greatest man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment con@@ sul@@ t@@ an@@ ts in hi@@ story, died age 9@@ 6@@ , a few years ago.    
 Pe@@ ter D@@ r@@ uck@@ er was a prof@@ ess@@ or of ph@@ i@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y before be@@ coming invol@@ ved in busin@@ ess, and this is what Pe@@ ter D@@ r@@ uck@@ er say@@ s: "@@ P@@ lan@@ ning is actually in@@ comp@@ ati@@ ble with an entreprene@@ u@@ ri@@ al society and econom@@ y."    
 P@@ lan@@ ning is the k@@ is@@ s of death of entrepreneur@@ shi@@ p.    
 So now you're re@@ building Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch without know@@ ing what the smar@@ test people in Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch want to do with their own money and their own energ@@ y.    
 You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you.    
 You have to offer them conf@@ identi@@ al@@ ity, pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y, you have to be f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic at hel@@ ping them, and then they will com@@ e, and they will come in dro@@ v@@ es.    
 In a community of 10@@ ,000 people, we get 2@@ 00 cli@@ ents.    
 Can you imagine a community of 4@@ 00@@ ,000 people, the intellig@@ ence and the pas@@ sion@@ ?    
 Wh@@ ich present@@ ation have you app@@ la@@ u@@ ded the most this mor@@ n@@ ing?    
 L@@ oc@@ al, pas@@ sion@@ ate people. That's who you have app@@ la@@ u@@ de@@ d.    
 So what I'm sa@@ ying is that entrepreneur@@ ship is where it's at.    
 We are at the end of the first indu@@ stri@@ al re@@ volu@@ tion -- n@@ on@@ re@@ new@@ able f@@ os@@ si@@ l fuel@@ s, man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ing -- and all of a sudd@@ en, we have systems which are not sustain@@ able.    
 The inter@@ n@@ al com@@ bus@@ tion eng@@ ine is not sustain@@ able.    
 F@@ re@@ on way of main@@ tain@@ ing things is not sustain@@ able.    
 What we have to look at is at how we fe@@ ed, cu@@ re, educ@@ at@@ e, transp@@ or@@ t, communic@@ ate for seven billion people in a sustain@@ able way.    
 The technologi@@ es do not ex@@ ist to do that.    
 Who is going to inv@@ ent the technology for the gre@@ en re@@ volu@@ tion@@ ? U@@ ni@@ ver@@ si@@ ti@@ es? F@@ or@@ get about it@@ !    
 Go@@ vern@@ ment@@ ? F@@ or@@ get about it@@ !    
 It will be entrepreneur@@ s, and they're doing it now.    
 There's a lo@@ vel@@ y story that I read in a fu@@ tu@@ ri@@ st mag@@ az@@ ine There was a group of exper@@ ts who were inv@@ ited to disc@@ us@@ s the future of the city of New York in 1@@ 8@@ 6@@ 0@@ .    
 And in 1@@ 8@@ 6@@ 0, this group of people came together, and they all spe@@ cul@@ ated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the con@@ cl@@ usi@@ on was un@@ anim@@ ous@@ : The city of New York would not ex@@ ist in 100 years.    
 Wh@@ y? Because they looked at the cur@@ ve and said, if the popula@@ tion keep@@ s growing at this r@@ at@@ e, to move the popula@@ tion of New York aroun@@ d, they would have needed six million hor@@ s@@ es, and the man@@ ure created by six million hor@@ ses would be impos@@ sible to deal with@@ .    
 They were already d@@ row@@ ning in man@@ u@@ re. So 1@@ 8@@ 6@@ 0, they are seeing this di@@ r@@ ty technology that is going to cho@@ ke the life out of New Yor@@ k.    
 So what happen@@ s? In 40 year@@ s' time, in the year 19@@ 00@@ , in the United States of Ameri@@ ca, there were 1@@ ,00@@ 1 car man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ing companies -- 1@@ ,00@@ 1@@ .    
 The idea of fin@@ ding a different technology had absolutely taken over@@ , and there were tin@@ y, tiny little fac@@ tor@@ ies in back@@ wat@@ ers.    
 D@@ ear@@ bor@@ n, Mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an. H@@ en@@ ry F@@ or@@ d.    
 H@@ o@@ we@@ ver, there is a secre@@ t to work with entrepreneur@@ s.    
 Fir@@ st, you have to offer them conf@@ identi@@ al@@ ity.    
 O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise they don't come and talk to you.    
 Then you have to offer them absolu@@ t@@ e, de@@ di@@ cat@@ ed, pas@@ sion@@ ate ser@@ vice to them.    
 And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneur@@ shi@@ p.    
 The sm@@ all@@ est compan@@ y, the biggest compan@@ y, has to be cap@@ able of doing three things beauti@@ ful@@ ly@@ : The produc@@ t that you want to sel@@ l has to be f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic@@ , you have to have f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic marke@@ ting, and you have to have trem@@ end@@ ous fin@@ anci@@ al man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment.    
 We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it, sel@@ l it and look after the mone@@ y.    
 It doesn't exist@@ .    
 This person has never been bor@@ n.    
 We've done the rese@@ arch@@ , and we have looked at the 100 ic@@ on@@ ic companies of the world -- C@@ ar@@ ne@@ gi@@ e, W@@ est@@ ing@@ hous@@ e, E@@ dis@@ on, F@@ or@@ d, all the new comp@@ ani@@ es, Goog@@ le, Y@@ a@@ h@@ oo@@ .    
 There's only one thing that all the success@@ ful companies in the world have in com@@ mon@@ , only one@@ : N@@ one were started by one pers@@ on.    
 in Nor@@ th@@ u@@ mb@@ er@@ lan@@ d, and we start the class by giving them the first two p@@ ages of Ri@@ ch@@ ard B@@ ran@@ son@@ 's au@@ to@@ bio@@ graph@@ y, and the t@@ ask of the 1@@ 6@@ -year-@@ ol@@ ds is to under@@ lin@@ e, in the first two p@@ ages of Ri@@ ch@@ ard B@@ ran@@ son@@ 's au@@ to@@ bio@@ graph@@ y how many times Ri@@ ch@@ ard us@@ es the word "@@ I@@ " and how many times he us@@ es the word "@@ we@@ ."    
 N@@ ever the word "@@ I@@ ," and the word "@@ we@@ " 3@@ 2 times.    
 He wasn't alone when he star@@ ted.    
 No@@ body started a company al@@ one. No one.    
 So we can create the community where we have fac@@ il@@ it@@ at@@ ors who come from a small business back@@ grou@@ nd sitting in ca@@ f@@ es, in bar@@ s, and your de@@ dic@@ ated bu@@ d@@ dies who will do to you, what somebody did for this g@@ ent@@ le@@ man who tal@@ ks about this ep@@ ic, somebody who will say to you, "What do you need@@ ?    
 What can you do@@ ? Can you make it?    
 Oka@@ y, can you sel@@ l it? Can you look after the mon@@ ey@@ ?"    
 "O@@ h, no@@ , I cannot do this@@ .@@ "@@ "@@ W@@ ould you like me to find you some@@ bod@@ y@@ ?"    
 We ac@@ tiv@@ ate communi@@ ties.    
 We have grou@@ ps of volunte@@ ers supp@@ or@@ ting the En@@ ter@@ pri@@ se F@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ at@@ or to help you to find resour@@ ces and people and we have discover@@ ed that the mirac@@ le of the intellig@@ ence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the econom@@ y of this community just by cap@@ tur@@ ing the pas@@ sion, the energy and imagin@@ ation of your own people.    
 Thank you.     
 There are a lot of ways the people around us can help impro@@ ve our lives.    
 We don't bu@@ m@@ p into every neighbor@@ , so a lot of wis@@ dom never gets pas@@ sed on, though we do share the same public spac@@ es.    
 So over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more with my neighbor@@ s in public space, using simple tools like s@@ tic@@ k@@ ers, st@@ enc@@ ils and ch@@ al@@ k.    
 And these projec@@ ts came from questions I ha@@ d, like@@ : How much are my neighbor@@ s pa@@ ying for their a@@ part@@ ment@@ s? How can we l@@ end and bor@@ row more things, without kno@@ c@@ king on each other@@ 's do@@ ors at a bad ti@@ me@@ ?    
 How can we share more memor@@ ies of our ab@@ an@@ don@@ ed build@@ ings, and ga@@ in a better understanding of our lan@@ ds@@ ca@@ pe@@ ?    
 How can we share more of our hop@@ es for our v@@ ac@@ ant store@@ f@@ ron@@ ts, so our communities can ref@@ le@@ ct our needs and dre@@ ams to@@ da@@ y?    
 Now, I live in New O@@ r@@ le@@ an@@ s, and I am in love with New O@@ r@@ le@@ an@@ s.    
 My sou@@ l is always s@@ oo@@ th@@ ed by the gi@@ ant live o@@ a@@ k tre@@ es, sha@@ ding lo@@ ver@@ s, d@@ run@@ ks and dre@@ am@@ ers for hundreds of years, and I trust a city that always makes way for mus@@ ic.    
 I feel like every time someone s@@ ne@@ e@@ z@@ es, New O@@ r@@ le@@ ans has a par@@ ad@@ e.    
   The city has some of the most beautiful architec@@ ture in the world, but it also has one of the high@@ est amoun@@ ts of ab@@ an@@ don@@ ed proper@@ ties in Ameri@@ ca@@ .    
 I live near this hous@@ e, and I thought about how I could make it a n@@ ic@@ er space for my neighbor@@ h@@ oo@@ d, and I also thought about something that changed my life fore@@ ver.    
 In 200@@ 9@@ , I lo@@ st someone I loved very much.    
 H@@ er name was Jo@@ an, and she was a mother to me.    
 And her death was sudd@@ en and u@@ nex@@ pec@@ ted.    
 And I thought about death a lo@@ t.    
 And ... this made me feel de@@ ep gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de for the time I've ha@@ d.    
 And ... brought cl@@ ar@@ ity to the things that are mean@@ ing@@ ful to my life now.    
 But I stru@@ gg@@ le to main@@ tain this perspec@@ tive in my da@@ ily life.    
 I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day@@ -@@ to-@@ day, and for@@ get what really mat@@ ters to you.    
 So with help from old and new friends, I turned the side of this ab@@ an@@ don@@ ed house into a gi@@ ant ch@@ al@@ k@@ bo@@ ar@@ d, and st@@ enc@@ il@@ ed it with a f@@ ill@@ -@@ in@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ bl@@ ank s@@ ent@@ enc@@ e: "@@ Be@@ fore I di@@ e, I want to ..@@ ."    
 So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of ch@@ al@@ k, ref@@ le@@ ct on their life, and share their person@@ al as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions in public spac@@ e.    
 I didn't know what to ex@@ pect from this experi@@ ment, but by the next day, the w@@ all was enti@@ rely f@@ ill@@ ed out, and it k@@ ept grow@@ ing.    
 And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this w@@ all.    
 "@@ Be@@ fore I di@@ e, I want to be tried for p@@ ir@@ ac@@ y." "@@ Be@@ fore I di@@ e, I want to stra@@ dd@@ le the Inter@@ national D@@ at@@ el@@ ine@@ ."    
 "@@ Be@@ fore I di@@ e, I want to sing for milli@@ on@@ s."    
 "@@ Be@@ fore I di@@ e, I want to plant a tre@@ e."    
 "@@ Be@@ fore I di@@ e, I want to live off the g@@ ri@@ d@@ ."    
 "@@ Be@@ fore I di@@ e, I want to hold her one more ti@@ me@@ ."    
 "@@ Be@@ fore I di@@ e, I want to be some@@ one's ca@@ val@@ r@@ y."    
 "@@ Be@@ fore I di@@ e, I want to be completely my@@ self@@ ."    
 So this ne@@ g@@ lec@@ ted space became a construc@@ tive one, and people@@ 's hop@@ es and dre@@ ams made me la@@ u@@ gh out l@@ ou@@ d, te@@ ar up, and they con@@ sol@@ ed me during my own tou@@ gh times.    
 It's about know@@ ing you're not al@@ one@@ ; it's about understanding our neighbor@@ s in new and en@@ light@@ ening wa@@ y@@ s@@ ; it's about making space for ref@@ lec@@ tion and contemp@@ la@@ tion, and remembering what really mat@@ ters most to us as we grow and change.    
 I made this last year, and started recei@@ ving hundreds of messa@@ g@@ es from pas@@ sion@@ ate people who wanted to make a w@@ all with their commun@@ ity.    
 So, my ci@@ vi@@ c cent@@ er colleag@@ u@@ es and I made a tool k@@ it, and now w@@ all@@ s have been made in countries around the world, including K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ stan@@ , South Afri@@ ca, A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a, Ar@@ g@@ ent@@ in@@ a, and bey@@ on@@ d.    
 To@@ ge@@ ther@@ , we've shown how powerful our public spac@@ es can be if we're given the opportunity to have a voic@@ e, and share more with one an@@ other.    
 Tw@@ o of the most valu@@ able things we have are time, and our relationshi@@ ps with other people.    
 In our age of increas@@ ing di@@ str@@ ac@@ tions, it's more important than ever to find ways to main@@ tain perspec@@ tive, and remember that life is bri@@ ef and t@@ end@@ er.    
 D@@ e@@ ath is something that we're often dis@@ coura@@ ged to talk ab@@ out, or even think ab@@ out, but I've realized that pre@@ par@@ ing for death is one of the most em@@ pow@@ ering things you can do.    
 Th@@ in@@ king about death cl@@ ari@@ fi@@ es your life.    
 Our sha@@ red spac@@ es can better ref@@ le@@ ct what mat@@ ters to us, as individu@@ als and as a commun@@ ity, and with more ways to share our hop@@ es, fear@@ s and stor@@ ies, the people around us can not only help us make better plac@@ es, they can help us le@@ ad better lives.    
 Thank you.    
   Thank you.    
 To@@ day I have just one re@@ ques@@ t.    
 P@@ le@@ ase don't tell me I'm normal@@ .    
 Now I'd like to intro@@ duce you to my bro@@ ther@@ s.    
 R@@ em@@ i is 2@@ 2@@ , t@@ all and very hand@@ som@@ e.    
 H@@ e's spe@@ e@@ ch@@ l@@ ess, but he communic@@ ates jo@@ y in a way that some of the best or@@ at@@ ors can@@ no@@ t.    
 R@@ em@@ i knows what love is.    
 He sha@@ res it un@@ condi@@ tion@@ ally and he sha@@ res it re@@ gar@@ d@@ l@@ ess.    
 H@@ e's not gre@@ ed@@ y. He doesn't see sk@@ in col@@ or.    
 He doesn't care about reli@@ gi@@ ous differ@@ enc@@ es, and get this: He has never told a li@@ e.    
 When he sing@@ s s@@ ong@@ s from our child@@ h@@ oo@@ d, at@@ temp@@ ting words that not even I could rememb@@ er, he re@@ min@@ ds me of one thing@@ : how little we know about the min@@ d, and how wonder@@ ful the un@@ known must be.    
 S@@ am@@ u@@ el is 1@@ 6@@ . H@@ e's t@@ all. H@@ e's very hand@@ som@@ e.    
 He has the most im@@ pec@@ ca@@ ble memor@@ y.    
 He has a sel@@ ec@@ tive one, thou@@ gh@@ .    
 He doesn't remember if he st@@ o@@ le my cho@@ col@@ ate bar@@ , but he rememb@@ ers the year of rele@@ ase for every s@@ ong on my i@@ P@@ o@@ d, conversa@@ tions we had when he was four@@ , wee@@ ing on my ar@@ m on the first ever ep@@ is@@ o@@ de of T@@ ele@@ tu@@ b@@ bi@@ es, and L@@ ad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a@@ 's bir@@ th@@ day.    
 D@@ on@@ 't they sound incredi@@ b@@ le@@ ?    
 But most people don't ag@@ re@@ e.    
 And in fact, because their min@@ ds don't fit into socie@@ ty@@ 's ver@@ sion of normal@@ , they're often by@@ pas@@ sed and mis@@ underst@@ oo@@ d.    
 But what lif@@ ted my heart and st@@ ren@@ g@@ th@@ ened my sou@@ l was that even though this was the case, al@@ though they were not seen as ordin@@ ar@@ y, this could only mean one thing@@ : that they were extraordinary -- au@@ ti@@ sti@@ c and extra@@ ordin@@ ary.    
 Now, for you who may be less famili@@ ar with the term "@@ au@@ ti@@ sm@@ ," it's a complex brain di@@ sor@@ der that affec@@ ts social communi@@ cation, learning and sometimes physical sk@@ ill@@ s.    
 It man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ ts in each individual differ@@ ent@@ ly, h@@ ence why R@@ em@@ i is so different from S@@ am.    
 And across the world, every 20 minut@@ es, one new person is di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed with au@@ ti@@ sm@@ , and al@@ though it's one of the fa@@ st@@ est@@ -@@ growing develop@@ mental di@@ sor@@ d@@ ers in the world, there is no known cause or cu@@ re.    
 And I cannot remember the first moment I en@@ coun@@ tered au@@ ti@@ sm@@ , but I cannot rec@@ all a day without it.    
 I was just three years old when my bro@@ ther came al@@ ong, I had a new being in my life.    
 And after a few months went b@@ y, I realized that he was differ@@ ent.    
 He scre@@ am@@ ed a lo@@ t.    
 He didn't want to play like the other b@@ ab@@ ies di@@ d, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me what@@ so@@ ever@@ .    
 R@@ em@@ i li@@ ved and re@@ ig@@ ned in his own world, with his own rul@@ es, and he found ple@@ as@@ ure in the sm@@ all@@ est things, like lin@@ ing up car@@ s around the room and star@@ ing at the was@@ h@@ ing machine and e@@ ating anything that came in betwe@@ en.    
 And as he grew old@@ er, he grew more differ@@ ent, and the differ@@ ences became more obvi@@ ous.    
 Y@@ et beyond the t@@ an@@ tru@@ ms and the fru@@ stra@@ tion and the ne@@ ver@@ -@@ ending hy@@ per@@ ac@@ tiv@@ ity was something really uniqu@@ e: a pu@@ re and inno@@ c@@ ent natu@@ re, a boy who saw the world without pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ e, a human who had never li@@ ed.    
 E@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary.    
 Now, I cannot den@@ y that there have been some challeng@@ ing moments in my family, moments where I've wi@@ sh@@ ed that they were just like me.    
 But I ca@@ st my mind back to the things that they@@ 've taught me about individu@@ ality and communi@@ cation and lo@@ ve, and I realize that these are things that I wouldn't want to change with normal@@ ity.    
 Nor@@ mal@@ ity over@@ looks the beau@@ ty that differ@@ ences give us, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wr@@ ong@@ .    
 It just means that there's a different kind of right.    
 And if I could communic@@ ate just one thing to R@@ em@@ i and to S@@ am and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal@@ .    
 You can be extra@@ ordin@@ ary.    
 Because au@@ ti@@ sti@@ c or not, the differ@@ ences that we have -- We've got a gi@@ f@@ t@@ ! Every@@ one's got a gi@@ ft inside of us, and in all hon@@ est@@ y, the pur@@ su@@ it of normal@@ ity is the ultim@@ ate s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice of pot@@ enti@@ al.    
 The chance for great@@ ness, for progres@@ s and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone el@@ se.    
 P@@ le@@ ase -- don't tell me I'm normal@@ .    
 Thank you.       
 F@@ i@@ ve years ago, I experienc@@ ed a bit of what it must have been like to be A@@ li@@ ce in W@@ on@@ der@@ lan@@ d.    
 P@@ en@@ n St@@ ate asked me, a communi@@ cations teach@@ er, to teach a communi@@ cations class for engine@@ ering stud@@ ents.    
 And I was s@@ care@@ d. Re@@ ally s@@ care@@ d. S@@ ca@@ red of these students with their big bra@@ ins and their big books and their bi@@ g, un@@ famili@@ ar wor@@ ds.    
 But as these conversa@@ tions un@@ fol@@ ded, I experienc@@ ed what A@@ li@@ ce must have when she went down that r@@ ab@@ bit ho@@ le and saw that door to a whole new world.    
 That's just how I felt as I had those conversa@@ tions with the stud@@ ents. I was ama@@ zed at the ideas that they ha@@ d, and I wanted other@@ s to experience this wonder@@ land as well.    
 And I believe the key to op@@ ening that door is great communi@@ ca@@ tion.    
 We des@@ per@@ ately need great communi@@ cation from our scientists and engine@@ ers in order to change the world.    
 Our scientists and engine@@ ers are the ones that are t@@ ack@@ ling our grand@@ est challeng@@ es, from energy to environment to health ca@@ re, am@@ ong other@@ s, and if we don't know about it and understand it, then the work isn't don@@ e, and I believe it's our respon@@ sib@@ ility as n@@ on-@@ scientists to have these interac@@ tions.    
 But these great conversa@@ tions can't oc@@ cu@@ r if our scientists and engine@@ ers don't inv@@ ite us in to see their wonder@@ lan@@ d.    
 So scientists and engine@@ ers, ple@@ as@@ e, talk ner@@ dy to us. I want to share a few ke@@ ys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sex@@ y and that your engine@@ ering is eng@@ ag@@ ing.    
 Fir@@ st question to answer for us@@ : so what@@ ?    
 T@@ ell us why your science is rele@@ v@@ ant to us.    
 D@@ on@@ 't just tell me that you study tra@@ be@@ cu@@ la@@ e, but tell me that you study tra@@ be@@ cu@@ la@@ e, which is the mes@@ h@@ -@@ like struc@@ ture of our b@@ ones because it's important to understanding and tre@@ ating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ is.    
 And when you're descri@@ bing your sci@@ ence, be@@ w@@ are of j@@ ar@@ g@@ on.    
 J@@ ar@@ g@@ on is a bar@@ ri@@ er to our understanding of your ide@@ as@@ .    
 Su@@ re, you can say "@@ sp@@ ati@@ al and temp@@ or@@ al@@ ," but why not just say "@@ space and ti@@ me@@ ," which is so much more acc@@ es@@ sible to us@@ ?    
 And making your ideas acc@@ es@@ sible is not the same as du@@ mb@@ ing it dow@@ n.    
 Instea@@ d, as E@@ in@@ ste@@ in said, make everything as simple as possib@@ le, but no simp@@ l@@ er.    
 You can c@@ lear@@ ly communic@@ ate your science without comp@@ rom@@ is@@ ing the ide@@ as@@ .    
 A few things to consid@@ er are having exam@@ pl@@ es, stories and an@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es. Th@@ ose are ways to eng@@ age and exc@@ ite us about your cont@@ ent.    
 And when present@@ ing your work, dro@@ p the bul@@ let poin@@ ts.    
 H@@ a@@ ve you ever wonder@@ ed why they're called bul@@ let poin@@ t@@ s? What do bul@@ le@@ ts do@@ ? B@@ ul@@ le@@ ts kill@@ , and they will kill your present@@ ation.    
 A sli@@ de like this is not only bor@@ ing, but it reli@@ es too much on the language area of our bra@@ in, and caus@@ es us to become over@@ wh@@ el@@ me@@ d.    
 Instea@@ d, this example sli@@ de by G@@ ene@@ vi@@ eve B@@ row@@ n is much more effec@@ tive. It's showing that the speci@@ al struc@@ ture of tra@@ be@@ cu@@ la@@ e are so strong that they actually inspi@@ red the unique design of the E@@ i@@ ff@@ el T@@ ow@@ er.    
 And the tri@@ ck here is to use a sing@@ le, read@@ able s@@ ent@@ ence that the audi@@ ence can key into if they get a bit lo@@ st, and then provid@@ e vi@@ su@@ als which appe@@ al to our other sen@@ ses and create a deep@@ er sense of understanding of what's being descri@@ be@@ d.    
 So I think these are just a few ke@@ ys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engine@@ er@@ ing.    
 And because the engine@@ ers that I've worked with have taught me to become really in tou@@ ch with my inner ner@@ d, I want to sum@@ mar@@ ize with an equ@@ ation. T@@ a@@ ke your sci@@ ence, sub@@ tr@@ act your bul@@ let poin@@ ts and your j@@ ar@@ g@@ on, di@@ vid@@ e by rele@@ v@@ anc@@ e, mean@@ ing share what's rele@@ v@@ ant to the audi@@ ence, and multi@@ p@@ ly it by the passion that you have for this incredi@@ ble work that you're do@@ ing, and that is going to equ@@ al incredi@@ ble interac@@ tions    
 that are full of under@@ stand@@ ing.    
 And so, scientists and engine@@ ers, when you've sol@@ ved this equ@@ ation, by all mean@@ s, talk ner@@ dy to me. Thank you.     
 the O@@ x@@ for@@ d Eng@@ lish D@@ ic@@ tionary is "@@ s@@ no@@ l@@ ly@@ go@@ ster@@ ."    
 Just because it soun@@ ds so goo@@ d.    
 And what s@@ no@@ l@@ ly@@ go@@ ster means is "@@ a dish@@ on@@ est poli@@ tici@@ an@@ ."    
 Al@@ though there was a 19@@ th@@ -@@ centur@@ y new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er ed@@ it@@ or who defin@@ ed it rather better when he said, "@@ A s@@ no@@ l@@ ly@@ go@@ ster is a fel@@ low who see@@ ks off@@ ice re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of part@@ y, pl@@ at@@ form or prin@@ ci@@ p@@ le, and wh@@ o, when he win@@ s, gets there by the she@@ er for@@ ce of mon@@ u@@ mental tal@@ kno@@ ph@@ ical as@@ sum@@ n@@ anc@@ y."    
   Now I have no idea what "@@ tal@@ kno@@ ph@@ ic@@ al@@ " is.    
 Some@@ thing to do with words, I as@@ su@@ me.    
 But it's very important that words are at the cent@@ er of poli@@ tic@@ s, and all poli@@ tici@@ ans know they have to try and control langu@@ age.    
 It wasn't un@@ til@@ , for example, 1@@ 7@@ 7@@ 1 that the B@@ ri@@ tis@@ h Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent allow@@ ed new@@ sp@@ a@@ per@@ s to repor@@ t the ex@@ act words that were said in the de@@ b@@ ating cha@@ mb@@ er.    
 And this was actually all down to the bra@@ very of a guy with the extraordinary name of Br@@ as@@ s C@@ ro@@ s@@ b@@ y, who took on Par@@ li@@ am@@ ent.    
 And he was th@@ row@@ n into the T@@ ow@@ er of L@@ on@@ d@@ on and imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ed, but he was bra@@ ve enou@@ gh, he was bra@@ ve enough to take them on, and in the end he had such pop@@ ular supp@@ ort in L@@ on@@ d@@ on that he w@@ on.    
 And it was only a few years later that we have the first rec@@ ord@@ ed use of the ph@@ r@@ ase "@@ as bo@@ ld as br@@ as@@ s." M@@ ost people think that's down to the me@@ tal@@ .    
 It's no@@ t. It's down to a camp@@ a@@ ig@@ ner for the freedom of the pres@@ s.    
 But to really show you how words and poli@@ tics interac@@ t, I want to take you back to the United States of Ameri@@ ca, just after they@@ 'd achiev@@ ed in@@ dep@@ end@@ ence.    
 And they had to face the question of what to call G@@ e@@ or@@ ge W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on, their lead@@ er.    
 They didn't know.    
 What do you call the lead@@ er of a re@@ publi@@ can countr@@ y?    
 And this was de@@ b@@ ated in C@@ ong@@ res@@ s for ages and ag@@ es.    
 And there were all sorts of sugg@@ es@@ tions on the table, which might have made it.    
 I mean, some people wanted him to be called C@@ hi@@ ef M@@ ag@@ i@@ str@@ ate W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on, and other people, H@@ is H@@ i@@ gh@@ ness G@@ e@@ or@@ ge W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on, and other people, P@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ tor of the Li@@ ber@@ ties of the People of the United States of Americ@@ a W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on.    
 Not that cat@@ ch@@ y.    
 Some people just wanted to call him K@@ ing.    
 They thought it was tried and tes@@ ted.    
 And they weren't even being mon@@ arch@@ ical there, they had the idea that you could be elec@@ ted K@@ ing for a fi@@ x@@ ed ter@@ m.    
 And, you know, it could have wor@@ ke@@ d.    
 And everybody got in@@ s@@ an@@ ely bo@@ re@@ d, actu@@ ally, because this de@@ b@@ ate went on for three wee@@ ks.    
 I read a di@@ ary of this po@@ or sen@@ at@@ or, who just keep@@ s coming back, "@@ S@@ ti@@ ll on this subjec@@ t@@ ."    
 And the reason for the del@@ a@@ y and the bo@@ re@@ dom was that the H@@ ouse of R@@ ep@@ res@@ ent@@ a@@ tiv@@ es were against the S@@ en@@ ate.    
 The H@@ ouse of R@@ ep@@ res@@ ent@@ a@@ tiv@@ es didn't want W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on to get d@@ run@@ k on pow@@ er.    
 They didn't want to call him K@@ ing in case that gave him ide@@ as, or his success@@ or ide@@ as@@ . So they wanted to give him the hu@@ mb@@ l@@ es@@ t, me@@ ag@@ er@@ es@@ t, most pa@@ the@@ tic ti@@ tle that they could think of.    
 And that ti@@ tle was "@@ Presid@@ ent@@ ."    
 Presid@@ ent. They didn't inv@@ ent the ti@@ t@@ le. I mean, it exist@@ ed before@@ , but it just me@@ ant somebody who pres@@ id@@ es over a me@@ et@@ ing.    
 It was like the fore@@ man of the j@@ ur@@ y.    
 than the term "@@ fore@@ man@@ " or "@@ over@@ se@@ er@@ ."    
 There were oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ al pres@@ id@@ ents of little col@@ on@@ ial coun@@ c@@ ils and b@@ its of govern@@ ment, but it was really a nothing ti@@ t@@ le.    
 And that's why the S@@ en@@ ate objec@@ ted to it.    
 They said, that's ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous, you can't call him Presid@@ ent.    
 This guy has to go and sig@@ n t@@ rea@@ ties and meet fore@@ ign dig@@ n@@ it@@ ari@@ es.    
 And who's going to take him seri@@ ously if he's got a sil@@ ly little ti@@ tle like Presid@@ ent of the United States of Ameri@@ ca@@ ?    
 And after three weeks of de@@ bat@@ e, in the end the S@@ en@@ ate did not ca@@ ve in.    
 Instea@@ d, they ag@@ re@@ ed to use the ti@@ tle "@@ Presid@@ ent@@ " for now, but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn't ag@@ ree with it from a dec@@ ent res@@ pect for the opini@@ ons and prac@@ tice of ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zed na@@ tions, whether under re@@ publi@@ can or mon@@ arch@@ ical forms of govern@@ ment, wh@@ ose cu@@ st@@ om it is to an@@ nex@@ , through the off@@ ice of the C@@ hi@@ ef M@@ ag@@ i@@ str@@ at@@ e, ti@@ t@@ les of res@@ pec@@ tab@@ ility -- not bloo@@ dy Presid@@ ent -- and that in the inter@@ course with fore@@ ign na@@ tions,    
 the maj@@ es@@ ty of the people of the United States may not be ha@@ z@@ ar@@ ded by an appe@@ ar@@ ance of sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity, i@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ , we don't want to look like bloo@@ dy we@@ ir@@ do@@ s.    
 Now you can learn three interesting things from this.    
 Fir@@ st of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I've ever been able to find out, the S@@ en@@ ate has never for@@ m@@ ally end@@ or@@ sed the ti@@ tle of Presid@@ ent.    
 B@@ ar@@ ack O@@ b@@ ama@@ , Presid@@ ent O@@ b@@ ama@@ , is there on bor@@ row@@ ed time, just wa@@ iting for the S@@ en@@ ate to sp@@ r@@ ing into ac@@ tion.    
 S@@ econ@@ d thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temp@@ or@@ ary measure -- -- you can still be wa@@ iting 2@@ 2@@ 3 years lat@@ er.    
 But the third thing you can lear@@ n, and this is the really important one, this is the point I want to leave you on, is that the ti@@ t@@ le, Presid@@ ent of the United States of Ameri@@ ca, doesn't sound that hu@@ mb@@ le at all these days, does it?    
 Some@@ thing to do with the sli@@ ght@@ ly over 5@@ ,000 nuc@@ le@@ ar war@@ head@@ s he has at his disp@@ os@@ al and the larg@@ est econom@@ y in the world and a f@@ le@@ et of d@@ ron@@ es and all that sort of stuff@@ .    
 Re@@ ality and history have en@@ dow@@ ed that ti@@ tle with gran@@ de@@ ur@@ .    
 And so the S@@ en@@ ate w@@ on in the en@@ d.    
 They got their ti@@ tle of res@@ pec@@ tab@@ ility.    
 And al@@ so, the S@@ en@@ at@@ e's other wor@@ r@@ y, the appe@@ ar@@ ance of sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity -- well, it was a sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity back th@@ en.    
 But now, do you know how many na@@ tions have a pres@@ id@@ ent@@ ?    
 A hundred and for@@ ty@@ -@@ se@@ ven@@ .    
 All because they want to sound like the guy who's got the 5@@ ,000 nuc@@ le@@ ar war@@ head@@ s, et@@ c@@ .    
 And so, in the end, the S@@ en@@ ate w@@ on and the H@@ ouse of R@@ ep@@ res@@ ent@@ a@@ tiv@@ es lo@@ st, because no@@ bod@@ y's going to feel that hu@@ mb@@ le the Presid@@ ent of the United States of Ameri@@ ca@@ .    
 And that's the important less@@ on I think you can take away, and the one I want to leave you with@@ .    
 P@@ o@@ li@@ tici@@ ans try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control real@@ ity, but in fact, reality changes words far more than words can ever change real@@ ity.    
 Thank you very much.    
 I'm 1@@ 50 fe@@ et down an il@@ leg@@ al m@@ ine sha@@ ft in G@@ han@@ a.    
 The air is th@@ ic@@ k with he@@ at and du@@ st, and it's hard to brea@@ the@@ .    
 I can feel the br@@ us@@ h of s@@ we@@ at@@ y bodies pas@@ sing me in the dar@@ k@@ ness, but I can't see much el@@ se.    
 I hear voic@@ es tal@@ king, but mo@@ st@@ ly the sha@@ ft is this ca@@ cop@@ hon@@ y of men cou@@ gh@@ ing, and st@@ one being bro@@ ken with pri@@ mi@@ tive tool@@ s.    
 Li@@ ke the other@@ s, I wear a f@@ lic@@ k@@ er@@ ing, chea@@ p fl@@ ash@@ light ti@@ ed to my head with this el@@ as@@ tic@@ , t@@ at@@ tered b@@ and, and I can b@@ are@@ ly make out the s@@ lic@@ k t@@ ree li@@ mb@@ s hol@@ ding up the w@@ all@@ s of the th@@ ree@@ -@@ foo@@ t squ@@ are ho@@ le dro@@ pp@@ ing hundreds of fe@@ et into the ear@@ th.    
 When my hand sli@@ ps, I suddenly remember a min@@ er I had met days before who had lo@@ st his g@@ ri@@ p and f@@ ell coun@@ t@@ less fe@@ et down that sha@@ f@@ t.    
 As I stand talking to you today, these men are still de@@ ep in that ho@@ le, ris@@ king their lives without pa@@ y@@ ment or comp@@ en@@ sa@@ tion, and often dy@@ ing.    
 I got to clim@@ b out of that ho@@ le, and I got to go hom@@ e, but they likely never will@@ , because they're tra@@ pped in sla@@ ver@@ y.    
 For the last 2@@ 8 years, I've been do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ing indi@@ gen@@ ous cul@@ tures in more than 7@@ 0 countries on six contin@@ ents, and in 200@@ 9 I had the great hon@@ or of being the so@@ le ex@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ or at the V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver Pe@@ ace S@@ um@@ m@@ it.    
 A@@ mon@@ g@@ st all the ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ing people I met there, I met a supp@@ or@@ ter of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves, an N@@ G@@ O de@@ dic@@ ated to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ating moder@@ n day sla@@ ver@@ y.    
 We started talking about sla@@ very, and re@@ ally, I started learning about sla@@ very, for I had certainly known it exist@@ ed in the world, but not to such a degre@@ e.    
 Af@@ ter we fin@@ ish@@ ed tal@@ king, I felt so hor@@ ri@@ ble and hon@@ es@@ tly as@@ ha@@ med at my own l@@ ack of knowledge of this at@@ ro@@ city in my own life@@ time, and I thought, if I don't know, how many other people don't know@@ ?    
 It started bur@@ ning a ho@@ le in my st@@ om@@ ach@@ , so within wee@@ ks, I f@@ le@@ w down to L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es to meet with the direc@@ tor of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves and offer them my hel@@ p.    
 Th@@ us began my jour@@ ney into moder@@ n day sla@@ ver@@ y.    
 O@@ dd@@ ly, I had been to many of these places before.    
 Some I even consid@@ ered like my second hom@@ e.    
 But this time, I would see the sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons h@@ idd@@ en in the close@@ t.    
 A con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive es@@ tim@@ ate tel@@ ls us there are more than 2@@ 7 million people en@@ sla@@ ved in the world today.    
 That's d@@ ou@@ ble the amount of people taken from Afri@@ c@@ a during the entire trans@@ -@@ A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic sla@@ ve tra@@ de.    
 A hundred and fi@@ f@@ ty years ago, an ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ tural sla@@ ve cost about three times the an@@ nu@@ al sal@@ ary of an American work@@ er.    
 That equ@@ ates to about $@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,000 in to@@ da@@ y's mone@@ y.    
 Y@@ et today, entire famili@@ es can be en@@ sla@@ ved for gener@@ ations over a de@@ b@@ t as small as $@@ 1@@ 8@@ . A@@ st@@ on@@ ish@@ ing@@ ly, sla@@ very gener@@ ates prof@@ its of more than $@@ 1@@ 3 billion world@@ w@@ ide each year.    
 M@@ any have been tric@@ ked by f@@ al@@ se prom@@ is@@ es of a good edu@@ cation, a better job@@ , only to find that they're forced to work without pa@@ y under the thre@@ at of viol@@ ence, and they cannot walk a@@ way.    
 To@@ da@@ y's sla@@ very is about comm@@ er@@ ce, so the goo@@ ds that en@@ sla@@ ved people produce have valu@@ e, but the people produc@@ ing them are disp@@ os@@ able.    
 S@@ la@@ very exist@@ s every@@ wher@@ e, ne@@ ar@@ ly, in the world, and yet it is il@@ leg@@ al every@@ where in the world.    
 In Indi@@ a and N@@ ep@@ al, I was intro@@ duc@@ ed to the bri@@ ck k@@ il@@ n@@ s.    
 This str@@ ange and aw@@ es@@ ome si@@ ght was like walking into ancient Egyp@@ t or D@@ an@@ te@@ 's In@@ fer@@ no@@ .    
 En@@ velop@@ ed in te@@ m@@ per@@ atu@@ res of 1@@ 30 degre@@ es, m@@ en, wom@@ en, children, entire famili@@ es in fact, were clo@@ a@@ ked in a hea@@ v@@ y b@@ lan@@ ket of du@@ st, while mechan@@ ically st@@ ac@@ king bri@@ c@@ ks on their hea@@ d, up to 1@@ 8 at a time, and car@@ r@@ ying them from the sc@@ or@@ ching k@@ il@@ ns to truc@@ ks hundreds of y@@ ar@@ ds a@@ way.    
 D@@ e@@ ad@@ ened by mon@@ o@@ ton@@ y and ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion, they work sil@@ ent@@ ly, doing this t@@ ask over and over for 1@@ 6 or 1@@ 7 hours a day.    
 There were no brea@@ ks for food, no water brea@@ ks, and the sever@@ e de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ consequ@@ enti@@ al.    
 So per@@ v@@ as@@ i@@ ve was the he@@ at and the d@@ ust that my camera became too ho@@ t to even tou@@ ch and c@@ eas@@ ed work@@ ing.    
 Every 20 minut@@ es, I'd have to run back to our cru@@ is@@ er to clean out my ge@@ ar and run it under an air condi@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it, and as I s@@ at there, I thought, my camera is getting far better tre@@ at@@ ment than these people.    
 B@@ ack in the k@@ il@@ n@@ s, I wanted to cr@@ y, but the abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist next to me quick@@ ly gr@@ ab@@ bed me and he said, "@@ Li@@ sa@@ , don't do that. Just don't do that her@@ e."    
 And he very c@@ lear@@ ly expla@@ ined to me that emo@@ tional disp@@ la@@ ys are very danger@@ ous in a place like this, I couldn't offer them any direc@@ t hel@@ p.    
 I couldn't give them mone@@ y, no@@ thing.    
 I wasn't a citi@@ z@@ en of that countr@@ y.    
 I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in.    
 I'd have to rely on F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves to work within the system for their li@@ ber@@ ation, and I trust@@ ed that they w@@ oul@@ d.    
 As for me, I'd have to wa@@ it until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ brea@@ k.    
 In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as, I found children car@@ r@@ ying st@@ one for miles down moun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ ra@@ in to truc@@ ks wa@@ iting at ro@@ ad@@ s bel@@ ow@@ .    
 The big she@@ e@@ ts of s@@ l@@ ate were hea@@ vi@@ er than the children car@@ r@@ ying them, and the kids ho@@ ist@@ ed them from their head@@ s using these hand@@ made har@@ n@@ ess@@ es of s@@ tic@@ ks and ro@@ pe and tor@@ n clo@@ th.    
 It's difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing.    
 How can we affec@@ t something so in@@ si@@ di@@ ous, yet so per@@ v@@ as@@ i@@ ve@@ ? Some don't even know they're en@@ sla@@ v@@ ed, people working 1@@ 6@@ , 1@@ 7 hours a day without any pa@@ y, because this has been the case all their lives.    
 They have nothing to comp@@ are it to.    
 When these v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ ers cla@@ im@@ ed their fre@@ ed@@ om@@ , the sla@@ ve@@ hol@@ d@@ ers bur@@ ned down all of their hous@@ es.    
 I mean, these people had no@@ thing, and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fi@@ ed, they wanted to give up, but the woman in the cent@@ er r@@ al@@ li@@ ed for them to per@@ sever@@ e, and abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ists on the grou@@ nd helped them get a quar@@ ry le@@ ase of their ow@@ n, so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ brea@@ king work, but they do it for them@@ selv@@ es, and they get pa@@ id for it, and they do it in fre@@ ed@@ om@@ .    
 Se@@ x tra@@ ffic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word sla@@ very, and because of this world@@ w@@ ide a@@ wa@@ ren@@ ess, I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work sa@@ f@@ ely within this particular indu@@ str@@ y.    
 In K@@ a@@ th@@ man@@ du@@ , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had pre@@ vi@@ ously been sex sla@@ ves them@@ selves.    
 They us@@ her@@ ed me down a nar@@ row set of sta@@ ir@@ s that led to this di@@ r@@ ty, di@@ m@@ ly flu@@ o@@ res@@ c@@ ent li@@ t bas@@ em@@ ent.    
 This wasn't a bro@@ the@@ l@@ , per se.    
 It was more like a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant.    
 C@@ ab@@ in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts, as they're known in the tra@@ de, are ven@@ u@@ es for forced pro@@ stitu@@ tion.    
 E@@ ach has sm@@ all, pri@@ v@@ ate room@@ s, where the sla@@ ves, wom@@ en, along with young girls and bo@@ ys, some as young as seven years old, are forced to enter@@ tain the cli@@ ents, en@@ coura@@ g@@ ing them to buy more food and al@@ co@@ hol@@ .    
 E@@ ach cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le is dar@@ k and d@@ ing@@ y, identi@@ fied with a pain@@ ted number on the w@@ all, and par@@ ti@@ tion@@ ed by pl@@ y@@ w@@ ood and a cur@@ tain@@ .    
 The work@@ ers here often end@@ ure tra@@ gic sex@@ u@@ al ab@@ use at the hands of their cu@@ st@@ om@@ ers.    
 St@@ an@@ ding in the near dar@@ k@@ ness, I remember feeling this quic@@ k, ho@@ t fear@@ , and in that instan@@ t, I could only imagine what it must be like to be tra@@ pped in that h@@ ell@@ .    
 I had only one way out@@ : the sta@@ ir@@ s from where I'd come in.    
 There were no back do@@ or@@ s.    
 There were no win@@ dow@@ s large enough to clim@@ b through@@ .    
 These people have no es@@ cap@@ e at all, and as we take in such a difficult subjec@@ t, it's important to no@@ te that sla@@ very, including sex tra@@ ffic@@ king, oc@@ cur@@ s in our own back@@ y@@ ard as well.    
 T@@ en@@ s of hundreds of people are en@@ sla@@ ved in ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture, in re@@ sta@@ ur@@ an@@ ts, in domestic ser@@ v@@ itu@@ de, and the li@@ st can go on.    
 R@@ ec@@ ent@@ ly, the New York T@@ im@@ es repor@@ ted that between 1@@ 00@@ ,000 and 3@@ 00@@ ,000 American children are so@@ ld into sex sla@@ very every year.    
 It's all around us. We just don't see it.    
 The t@@ ex@@ ti@@ le indu@@ str@@ y is another one we often think of when we hear about sla@@ ve lab@@ or.    
 I vis@@ ited v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ es in Indi@@ a where entire famili@@ es were en@@ sla@@ ved in the sil@@ k tra@@ de.    
 This is a family por@@ tra@@ it.    
 The d@@ yed black hands are the father@@ , while the bl@@ ue and red hands are his son@@ s.    
 They mi@@ x dy@@ e in these big bar@@ rel@@ s, and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the li@@ qu@@ id up to their el@@ bo@@ w@@ s, but the dy@@ e is to@@ x@@ ic.    
 My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stor@@ ies.    
 "@@ We have no fre@@ ed@@ om@@ ," they said@@ .    
 "@@ We hope sti@@ ll@@ , thou@@ gh, that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get pa@@ id for our d@@ ye@@ ing@@ ."    
 It's es@@ tim@@ ated that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ sla@@ ved on L@@ a@@ ke V@@ ol@@ ta@@ , When we first arri@@ v@@ ed, I went to have a quic@@ k loo@@ k.    
 I saw what seemed to be a family fish@@ ing on a bo@@ at, two ol@@ der bro@@ ther@@ s, some youn@@ g@@ er kid@@ s, makes sense right?    
 W@@ r@@ ong@@ . They were all en@@ sla@@ v@@ ed.    
 Ch@@ il@@ d@@ ren are taken from their famili@@ es and tra@@ ffic@@ ked and v@@ ani@@ sh@@ ed, and they're forced to work end@@ less hours on these bo@@ at@@ s on the la@@ ke, even though they do not know how to s@@ wi@@ m.    
 This young child is eight years ol@@ d.    
 He was tre@@ mb@@ ling when our bo@@ at appro@@ ac@@ he@@ d, fri@@ ght@@ ened it would run over his tiny can@@ o@@ e.    
 He was pe@@ tri@@ fied he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water.    
 The sk@@ el@@ et@@ al t@@ ree li@@ mb@@ s sub@@ mer@@ ged in L@@ a@@ ke V@@ ol@@ t@@ a often cat@@ ch the fish@@ ing ne@@ ts, and we@@ ar@@ y, fri@@ ght@@ ened children are th@@ row@@ n into the water to unte@@ ther the lin@@ es.    
 M@@ any of them d@@ row@@ n.    
 For as long as he can rec@@ all, he's been forced to work on the la@@ k@@ e.    
 T@@ er@@ ri@@ fied of his ma@@ st@@ er, he will not run away, and since he's been tre@@ ated with cru@@ el@@ ty all his life, he pas@@ ses that down to the youn@@ g@@ er sla@@ ves that he manag@@ es.    
 I met these bo@@ ys at five in the morning, when they were ha@@ ul@@ ing in the last of their ne@@ ts, but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m.    
 in the col@@ d, win@@ dy ni@@ ght.    
 And it's important to no@@ te that these ne@@ ts we@@ i@@ gh more than a thous@@ and p@@ oun@@ ds when they're full of fish@@ .    
 I want to intro@@ duce you to K@@ o@@ fi@@ .    
 K@@ of@@ i was res@@ cu@@ ed from a fish@@ ing v@@ il@@ la@@ g@@ e.    
 I met him at a sh@@ el@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves re@@ ha@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ates victim@@ s of sla@@ ver@@ y.    
 Here he's seen taking a b@@ ath at the well, p@@ our@@ ing big b@@ uc@@ ke@@ ts of water over his hea@@ d, and the wonder@@ ful news is, as you and I are sitting here talking today, K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ un@@ ited with his family, and what's even bet@@ ter, his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children sa@@ f@@ e.    
 K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possib@@ ility.    
 Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life@@ ?    
 D@@ ri@@ ving down a road in G@@ han@@ a with part@@ n@@ ers of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves, a fel@@ low abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist on a m@@ op@@ ed suddenly sp@@ ed up to our cru@@ is@@ er and ta@@ pped on the win@@ dow@@ .    
 He told us to follow him down a di@@ r@@ t road into the j@@ un@@ g@@ le.    
 At the end of the roa@@ d, he ur@@ ged us out of the car@@ , and told the dri@@ ver to quick@@ ly lea@@ ve.    
 Then he poin@@ ted tow@@ ard this b@@ are@@ ly vi@@ sible foo@@ t@@ pa@@ th, and said, "@@ This is the pa@@ th, this is the pa@@ th. Go@@ ."    
 As we started down the pa@@ th, we push@@ ed as@@ ide the v@@ ines bloc@@ king the way, and after about an hour of walking in, found that the tra@@ il had become f@@ loo@@ ded by recent ra@@ in@@ s, so I ho@@ ist@@ ed the pho@@ to ge@@ ar abo@@ ve my head as we des@@ c@@ ended into these wat@@ ers up to my ch@@ es@@ t.    
 Af@@ ter another two hours of hi@@ king, the win@@ ding tra@@ il ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly ended at a c@@ lear@@ ing, and before us was a ma@@ ss of hol@@ es that could fit into the si@@ ze of a foo@@ t@@ b@@ all fiel@@ d, and all of them were full of en@@ sla@@ ved people labor@@ ing.    
 M@@ any women had children stra@@ pped to their bac@@ ks while they were pan@@ ning for go@@ l@@ d, wa@@ ding in water po@@ is@@ on@@ ed by mer@@ cur@@ y.    
 M@@ er@@ cur@@ y is used in the ex@@ trac@@ tion proc@@ ess.    
 These min@@ ers are en@@ sla@@ ved in a m@@ ine sha@@ ft in another part of G@@ han@@ a.    
 When they came out of the sha@@ f@@ t, they were so@@ a@@ king we@@ t from their own s@@ we@@ at.    
 I remember looking into their ti@@ re@@ d, bloo@@ d@@ sho@@ t ey@@ es, for many of them had been under@@ grou@@ nd for 7@@ 2 hour@@ s.    
 The sha@@ f@@ ts are up to 3@@ 00 fe@@ et deep@@ , and they car@@ ry out hea@@ v@@ y b@@ ag@@ s of st@@ one that later will be transp@@ or@@ ted to another a@@ rea@@ , where the st@@ one will be p@@ oun@@ ded so that they can ex@@ tr@@ act the go@@ l@@ d.    
 At first g@@ lan@@ ce, the p@@ oun@@ ding s@@ ite seems full of powerful m@@ en, but when we look clo@@ s@@ er, we see some less fortun@@ ate working on the f@@ r@@ ing@@ es, and children too@@ .    
 All of them are vic@@ ti@@ m to in@@ j@@ ur@@ y, ill@@ ness and viol@@ ence.    
 In fact, it's very likely that this mus@@ cu@@ lar person will end up like this one here, rac@@ ked with tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mer@@ cur@@ y po@@ is@@ on@@ ing in just a few years.    
 This is Man@@ ur@@ u@@ . When his father di@@ ed, his un@@ cle tra@@ ffic@@ ked him to work with him in the min@@ es.    
 When his un@@ cle di@@ ed, Man@@ ur@@ u in@@ her@@ ited his un@@ cle@@ 's de@@ b@@ t, which f@@ ur@@ ther forced him into being en@@ sla@@ ved in the min@@ es.    
 When I met him, he had been working in the min@@ es for 1@@ 4 years, and the le@@ g in@@ j@@ ur@@ y that you see here is actually from a min@@ ing acc@@ id@@ ent, one so sever@@ e doc@@ tors say his le@@ g should be am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated.    
 On top of that, Man@@ ur@@ u has tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ si@@ s, yet he's still forced to work day in and day out in that m@@ ine sha@@ f@@ t.    
 E@@ ven sti@@ ll@@ , he has a dream that he will become free and become educ@@ ated with the help of local ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves, and it's this sort of de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation, in the face of un@@ imagin@@ able o@@ dd@@ s, that f@@ ill@@ s me with comple@@ te aw@@ e.    
 I want to sh@@ ine a light on sla@@ ver@@ y.    
 When I was working in the fiel@@ d, I brought lots of can@@ d@@ les with me, and with the help of my inter@@ pre@@ ter, I imp@@ ar@@ ted to the people I was photograph@@ ing that I wanted to ill@@ u@@ min@@ ate their stories and their p@@ li@@ ght, so when it was sa@@ fe for them, and sa@@ fe for me, I made these imag@@ es.    
 They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world.    
 I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ aring wit@@ ness to them, and that we will do what@@ ever we can to help make a difference in their lives.    
 I truly believ@@ e, if we can see one another as fel@@ low human be@@ ings, then it becomes very difficult to t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate at@@ ro@@ cities like sla@@ ver@@ y.    
 These images are not of issu@@ es. They are of people, real people, like you and me, all deser@@ ving of the same ri@@ ght@@ s, dig@@ n@@ ity and res@@ pect in their lives.    
 There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of these many beauti@@ ful, mi@@ stre@@ ated people I've had the trem@@ end@@ ous hon@@ or of me@@ et@@ ing.    
 I hope that these images a@@ wa@@ ken a for@@ ce in those who view them, people like you, and I hope that for@@ ce will ig@@ n@@ ite a fi@@ re, and that fire will sh@@ ine a light on sla@@ very, for without that li@@ ght, the be@@ ast of bon@@ da@@ ge can contin@@ ue to live in the sha@@ dow@@ s.    
 Thank you very much.    
 So, well, I do appli@@ ed ma@@ th, and this is a pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar problem for anyone who does appli@@ ed ma@@ th, is that we are like man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment con@@ sul@@ t@@ an@@ ts.    
 No one knows what the hel@@ l we do.    
 So I am going to give you some -- at@@ temp@@ t today to try and explain to you what I do.    
 So, danc@@ ing is one of the most human of ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties.    
 We de@@ light at bal@@ let virtu@@ os@@ os and ta@@ p danc@@ ers you will see later on.    
 Now, bal@@ let re@@ qui@@ res an extraordinary level of exper@@ ti@@ se and a high level of sk@@ ill@@ , and probably a level of initi@@ al su@@ it@@ ability that may well have a genetic comp@@ on@@ ent to it.    
 Now, sa@@ d@@ ly, neuro@@ logical di@@ sor@@ d@@ ers such as Par@@ kin@@ son@@ 's dise@@ ase gradu@@ ally des@@ tro@@ y this extraordinary ab@@ il@@ ity, as it is doing to my friend J@@ an S@@ tri@@ pl@@ ing, who was a virtu@@ os@@ o bal@@ let danc@@ er in his time.    
 So great progres@@ s and tre@@ at@@ ment has been made over the years.    
 H@@ o@@ we@@ ver, there are 6@@ .@@ 3 million people world@@ w@@ ide who have the diseas@@ e, and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able we@@ ak@@ ness, tre@@ mor@@ , ri@@ g@@ id@@ ity and the other sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s that go along with the diseas@@ e, so what we need are objec@@ tive tools to de@@ te@@ ct the dise@@ ase before it's too lat@@ e.    
 We need to be able to measure progres@@ sion objec@@ tiv@@ ely, and ultim@@ ately, the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cu@@ re is when we have an objec@@ tive measure that can answer that for su@@ re.    
 But fru@@ str@@ at@@ ing@@ ly, with Par@@ kin@@ son@@ 's dise@@ ase and other mov@@ ement di@@ sor@@ der@@ s, there are no bi@@ om@@ ar@@ k@@ ers, so there's no simple blood test that you can do, and the best that we have is like this 20@@ -@@ min@@ u@@ te neuro@@ log@@ ist tes@@ t.    
 You have to go to the cl@@ in@@ ic to do it. It's very, very co@@ st@@ ly, and that means that, outside the cl@@ ini@@ cal tri@@ als, it's just never don@@ e. It's never don@@ e.    
 But what if pati@@ ents could do this test at home@@ ?    
 Now, that would actually save on a difficult tri@@ p to the cl@@ in@@ ic, and what if pati@@ ents could do that test them@@ selv@@ es, right?    
 No exp@@ en@@ sive st@@ af@@ f time re@@ qui@@ re@@ d.    
 T@@ a@@ kes about $@@ 3@@ 00@@ , by the way, in the neuro@@ logi@@ st@@ 's cl@@ in@@ ic to do it. So what I want to pro@@ p@@ ose to you as an un@@ con@@ ven@@ tional way in which we can try to achi@@ eve this, be@@ cause, you see, in one sen@@ se, at lea@@ st, we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an S@@ tri@@ pl@@ ing.    
 So here we have a video of the vi@@ br@@ ating vo@@ cal fol@@ ds.    
 Now, this is health@@ y and this is somebody making spe@@ ec@@ h soun@@ ds, and we can think of ourselves as vo@@ cal bal@@ let d@@ an@@ cer@@ s, because we have to co@@ ordin@@ ate all of these vo@@ cal org@@ ans have the gen@@ es for it. F@@ o@@ x@@ P@@ 2@@ , for examp@@ le.    
 And like bal@@ le@@ t, it takes an extraordinary level of tra@@ in@@ ing.    
 I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to spea@@ k.    
 F@@ rom the soun@@ d, we can actually tr@@ ack the vo@@ cal f@@ old posi@@ tion as it vi@@ br@@ ates, and just as the li@@ mb@@ s are affec@@ ted in Par@@ kin@@ son@@ '@@ s, so too are the vo@@ cal organ@@ s.    
 So on the bo@@ t@@ to@@ m trac@@ e, you can see an example of ir@@ re@@ gu@@ lar vo@@ cal f@@ old tre@@ mor@@ .    
 We see all the same sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s.    
 We see vo@@ cal tre@@ mor@@ , we@@ ak@@ ness and ri@@ g@@ id@@ ity.    
 The spe@@ ec@@ h actually becomes qui@@ e@@ ter and more brea@@ th@@ y So these vo@@ cal effec@@ ts can actually be quite sub@@ t@@ le, in some cas@@ es, but with any digital micro@@ ph@@ one, and using pre@@ ci@@ sion vo@@ ice an@@ aly@@ sis so@@ f@@ tw@@ are in comb@@ in@@ ation with the lat@@ est in machine lear@@ ning, which is very adv@@ anc@@ ed by now, we can now quan@@ ti@@ fy exactly where somebody li@@ es on a contin@@ u@@ um between health and dise@@ ase using vo@@ ice sig@@ n@@ als al@@ one.    
 So these voic@@ e-@@ based tes@@ ts, how do they st@@ ack up against exper@@ t cl@@ ini@@ cal tes@@ t@@ s? We@@ '@@ ll@@ , they're both n@@ on-@@ inv@@ as@@ i@@ ve.    
 The neuro@@ logi@@ st@@ 's test is n@@ on-@@ inv@@ as@@ i@@ ve. They both use exist@@ ing in@@ fra@@ struc@@ ture.    
 You don't have to design a whole new set of hosp@@ it@@ als to do it.    
 And they're both acc@@ ur@@ ate. Oka@@ y, but in ad@@ di@@ tion, voic@@ e-@@ based tes@@ ts are n@@ on-@@ exper@@ t.    
 That means they can be self-@@ ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er@@ ed.    
 They're high@@ -@@ spe@@ ed, take about 30 secon@@ ds at mo@@ st.    
 They're ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low co@@ st, and we all know what happen@@ s.    
 When something becomes ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low co@@ st, it becomes mas@@ si@@ vel@@ y scal@@ able.    
 So here are some amazing go@@ als that I think we can deal with now.    
 We can re@@ duce log@@ is@@ tical diffic@@ ul@@ ties with pati@@ ents.    
 No need to go to the cl@@ in@@ ic for a rou@@ t@@ ine chec@@ k@@ up.    
 We can do high@@ -@@ fre@@ qu@@ ency mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing to get objec@@ tive dat@@ a.    
 We can per@@ form low@@ -@@ cost ma@@ ss rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ment for cl@@ ini@@ cal tri@@ als, and we can make popula@@ tion@@ -@@ scale scre@@ ening fe@@ as@@ i@@ ble for the first time.    
 We have the opportunity to start to se@@ arch for the ear@@ ly bi@@ om@@ ar@@ k@@ ers of the dise@@ ase before it's too lat@@ e.    
 So, taking the first st@@ ep@@ s towards this today, we're la@@ un@@ ching the Par@@ kin@@ son@@ 's V@@ o@@ ice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ a@@ tive.    
 With A@@ cu@@ la@@ b and P@@ ati@@ ent@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ M@@ e, we're a@@ im@@ ing to rec@@ ord a very large number of voic@@ es world@@ w@@ ide to colle@@ ct enough data to start to t@@ ack@@ le these four go@@ als.    
 We have local numb@@ ers acc@@ es@@ sible to three quar@@ ters of a billion people on the planet.    
 An@@ y@@ one health@@ y or with Par@@ kin@@ son@@ 's can call in, chea@@ pl@@ y, and leave rec@@ ord@@ ings, a few c@@ ents e@@ ach@@ , and I'm really happy to an@@ n@@ oun@@ ce that we've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hour@@ s.    
 Thank you. T@@ om Ri@@ ell@@ y@@ : So Ma@@ x, by taking all these sam@@ ples of, let's say, 10@@ ,000 people, you'll be able to tell who's health@@ y and who's no@@ t?    
 What are you going to get out of those sam@@ pl@@ es?    
 Ma@@ x L@@ it@@ t@@ le@@ : Yea@@ h. Yea@@ h. So what will happen is that, during the call you have to indi@@ c@@ ate whether or not you have the dise@@ ase or not, you se@@ e. T@@ R@@ : Ri@@ ght.    
 M@@ L@@ : You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.    
 But we@@ 'll get a very large sam@@ ple of data that is collec@@ ted in different cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ on@@ ing out the conf@@ oun@@ ding fac@@ tor@@ s, and looking for the actu@@ al mar@@ k@@ ers of the diseas@@ e.    
 T@@ R@@ : So you're 8@@ 6 percent acc@@ ur@@ ate right now@@ ?    
 M@@ L@@ : It's much better than that.    
 A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally, my stud@@ ent Th@@ an@@ as@@ is, I have to pl@@ u@@ g him, because he's done some f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic work, and now he has pro@@ ved that it wor@@ ks over the mobile tel@@ e@@ phone net@@ work as well, which en@@ ab@@ les this projec@@ t, and we're getting 9@@ 9 percent acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y.    
 T@@ R@@ : N@@ ine@@ ty@@ -@@ n@@ ine. Well, that's an impro@@ v@@ em@@ ent.    
 So what that means is that people will be able to — M@@ L@@ : T@@ R@@ : People will be able to call in from their mobile ph@@ ones and do this tes@@ t, and people with Par@@ kin@@ son@@ 's could call in, rec@@ ord their voic@@ e, and then their doctor can chec@@ k up on their progres@@ s, see where they're doing in this course of the diseas@@ e.    
 M@@ L@@ : A@@ b@@ solu@@ tel@@ y.    
 T@@ R@@ : Th@@ an@@ ks so much. Ma@@ x L@@ it@@ t@@ le, every@@ bod@@ y.    
 M@@ L@@ : Th@@ an@@ ks, T@@ om@@ .     
 Be@@ fore M@@ arch@@ , 20@@ 1@@ 1, I was a photograph@@ ic re@@ tou@@ ch@@ er based in New York C@@ ity.    
 We're p@@ al@@ e, gra@@ y creatu@@ re@@ s.    
 We h@@ ide in dar@@ k, win@@ dow@@ less room@@ s, and gener@@ ally a@@ vo@@ id sun@@ li@@ ght.    
 We make sk@@ in@@ ny model@@ s sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er, perfect sk@@ in more perfec@@ t, and the impos@@ sible possib@@ le, and we get cri@@ tici@@ zed in the pres@@ s all the time, but some of us are actually tal@@ ent@@ ed arti@@ sts with years of experience and a real app@@ reci@@ ation for images and photograph@@ y.    
 On M@@ arch 1@@ 1, 20@@ 1@@ 1, I wat@@ ched from hom@@ e, as the rest of the world di@@ d, as the tra@@ gic ev@@ ents un@@ fol@@ ded in J@@ ap@@ an.    
 S@@ o@@ on af@@ ter, an organ@@ iz@@ ation I volunte@@ er with@@ , All H@@ ands V@@ ol@@ unte@@ ers, were on the grou@@ n@@ d, within days, working as part of the respon@@ se eff@@ ort@@ s.    
 I@@ , along with hundreds of other volunte@@ ers, knew we couldn't just s@@ it at hom@@ e, so I decided to jo@@ in them for three wee@@ ks.    
 On Ma@@ y the 1@@ 3@@ th, I made my way to the town of Ō@@ fun@@ at@@ o.    
 It's a small fish@@ ing town in I@@ w@@ ate P@@ re@@ fec@@ ture, about 5@@ 0@@ ,000 people, one of the first that was hit by the wa@@ ve.    
 The wat@@ ers here have been rec@@ ord@@ ed at reach@@ ing over 2@@ 4 me@@ ters in he@@ i@@ ght, and tra@@ vel@@ ed over two miles in@@ lan@@ d.    
 As you can imagin@@ e, the town had been de@@ va@@ st@@ ated.    
 We pul@@ led de@@ br@@ is from can@@ als and d@@ it@@ ch@@ es.    
 We cle@@ an@@ ed school@@ s. We de@@ -@@ mu@@ dd@@ ed and gu@@ t@@ ted hom@@ es ready for re@@ no@@ v@@ ation and re@@ ha@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ ation.    
 We cle@@ ared tons and tons of st@@ in@@ king, ro@@ tting fish car@@ cas@@ ses from the local fish process@@ ing plan@@ t.    
 We got di@@ r@@ ty, and we loved it.    
 For wee@@ ks, all the volunte@@ ers and loc@@ als ali@@ ke had been fin@@ ding si@@ mil@@ ar things.    
 The@@ y@@ 'd been fin@@ ding photos and pho@@ to al@@ bu@@ ms and camer@@ as and S@@ D car@@ ds.    
 And everyone was doing the sam@@ e.    
 They were collec@@ ting them up, and han@@ ding them in to Now, it wasn't until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the person@@ al lo@@ ss these people had fel@@ t.    
 As they had run from the wa@@ ve, and for their liv@@ es, absolutely everything they ha@@ d, everything had to be left beh@@ in@@ d.    
 At the end of my first week there, I found myself hel@@ ping out in an ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ation cent@@ er in the tow@@ n.    
 I was hel@@ ping clean the on@@ sen@@ , the commun@@ al on@@ sen@@ , the huge gi@@ ant ba@@ th@@ tu@@ b@@ s. This happened to also be a place in the town where the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ation cent@@ er was collec@@ ting the photo@@ s.    
 This is where people were han@@ ding them in, and I was hon@@ ore@@ d that day that they actually trust@@ ed me to help them start han@@ d-@@ cle@@ an@@ ing them.    
 Now, it was emo@@ tional and it was in@@ spir@@ ing, and I've always heard about thinking outside the bo@@ x, but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my bo@@ x that something happen@@ ed.    
 As I looked through the photo@@ s, there were some were over a hundred years old, some still in the en@@ velop@@ e from the process@@ ing lab@@ , I couldn't help but think as a re@@ tou@@ ch@@ er that I could fi@@ x that te@@ ar and m@@ end that sc@@ r@@ at@@ ch, and I knew hundreds of people who could do the sam@@ e.    
 So that even@@ ing, I just reach@@ ed out on F@@ ace@@ book and asked a few of them, and by mor@@ ning the respon@@ se had been so over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing and so posi@@ tive, I knew we had to give it a go.    
 So we started re@@ tou@@ ching photo@@ s.    
 This was the very fir@@ st.    
 Not terri@@ b@@ ly da@@ ma@@ ge@@ d, but where the water had ca@@ used that dis@@ color@@ ation on the girl@@ 's face had to be re@@ pa@@ i@@ red with such acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y and deli@@ ca@@ c@@ y.    
 O@@ ther@@ wis@@ e, that little girl isn't going to look like that little girl any@@ mo@@ re, and su@@ rely that's as tra@@ gic as having the pho@@ to da@@ ma@@ ge@@ d.    
   O@@ ver time, more photos came in, th@@ an@@ k@@ ful@@ ly, and more re@@ tou@@ ch@@ ers were ne@@ e@@ ded, and so I reach@@ ed out again on F@@ ace@@ book and L@@ in@@ ke@@ d@@ In@@ , and within five days, 8@@ 0 people wanted to help from 1@@ 2 different countri@@ es.    
 Wi@@ th@@ in two wee@@ ks, I had 1@@ 50 people wan@@ ting to jo@@ in in.    
 Wi@@ th@@ in J@@ ap@@ an, by J@@ ul@@ y, we@@ 'd bran@@ ched out to the neighbor@@ ing town of Ri@@ k@@ u@@ z@@ ent@@ ak@@ at@@ a, f@@ ur@@ ther nor@@ th to a town called Y@@ ama@@ da@@ .    
 O@@ n@@ ce a wee@@ k, we would set up our s@@ can@@ ning e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment in the temp@@ or@@ ary pho@@ to li@@ br@@ ar@@ ies that had been set up, where people were rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing their photo@@ s.    
 The ol@@ der la@@ dies sometimes ha@@ dn't seen a s@@ can@@ ner before@@ , but within 10 minut@@ es of them fin@@ ding their lo@@ st photo@@ , they could give it to us, have it s@@ can@@ ne@@ d, up@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed to a cl@@ oud ser@@ ver, it would be down@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed by a ga@@ i@@ j@@ in, a strang@@ er, some@@ where on the other side of the glo@@ be, and it@@ 'd start being fi@@ x@@ ed.    
 The time it too@@ k, ho@@ we@@ ver, to get it back is a completely different story, and it dep@@ ended obvi@@ ously on the da@@ mage invol@@ v@@ ed.    
 It could take an hour@@ . It could take wee@@ ks. It could take month@@ s.    
 The ki@@ mon@@ o in this sho@@ t pretty much had to be han@@ d-@@ dra@@ w@@ n, or piec@@ ed together, pic@@ king out the re@@ ma@@ ining par@@ ts of color and deta@@ il that the water ha@@ dn't da@@ ma@@ ge@@ d.    
 It was very ti@@ me@@ -@@ con@@ sum@@ ing.    
 Now, all these photos had been da@@ mag@@ ed by wat@@ er, sub@@ mer@@ ged in sal@@ t wat@@ er, cover@@ ed in bacteri@@ a, in se@@ wa@@ g@@ e, sometimes even in o@@ il, all of which over time is going to contin@@ ue to da@@ mage them, so han@@ d-@@ cle@@ an@@ ing them was a huge part of the projec@@ t.    
 We couldn't re@@ tou@@ ch the pho@@ to un@@ less it was cle@@ an@@ ed, d@@ ry and rec@@ la@@ i@@ me@@ d.    
 Now, we were luck@@ y with our han@@ d-@@ cle@@ an@@ ing.    
 We had an amazing local woman who gu@@ ided us.    
 It's very easy to do more da@@ mage to those da@@ mag@@ ed photo@@ s.    
 As my team lead@@ er W@@ y@@ n@@ ne once said, it's like doing a t@@ at@@ too on some@@ one.    
 You don't get a chance to m@@ ess it up.    
 The la@@ dy who brought us these photos was luck@@ y, as far as the photos go.    
 She had started han@@ d-@@ cle@@ an@@ ing them her@@ self and stopped when she realized she was doing more da@@ mag@@ e.    
 She also had du@@ p@@ lic@@ at@@ es.    
 A@@ re@@ as like her h@@ us@@ b@@ and and her fac@@ e, which other@@ w@@ ise would have been completely impos@@ sible to fi@@ x, we could just put them together in one good photo@@ , and re@@ make the whole photo@@ .    
 When she collec@@ ted the photos from us, she sha@@ red a bit of her story with us.    
 H@@ er photos were found by her h@@ us@@ ban@@ d@@ 's colleag@@ u@@ es at a local fire de@@ partment in the de@@ br@@ is a long way from where the home had once st@@ oo@@ d, and they@@ 'd recog@@ n@@ ized him.    
 The day of the t@@ sun@@ am@@ i@@ , he@@ 'd actually been in char@@ ge of making sure the t@@ sun@@ am@@ i g@@ ates were close@@ d.    
 He had to go towards the water as the si@@ ren@@ s soun@@ de@@ d.    
 H@@ er two little bo@@ ys, not so little any@@ mo@@ re, but her two bo@@ ys were both at school, se@@ par@@ ate school@@ s.    
 One of them got caught up in the water.    
 It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survi@@ v@@ ed.    
 The day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youn@@ g@@ est son@@ 's 1@@ 4@@ th bir@@ th@@ day.    
 For her, des@@ p@@ ite all of this, those photos were the perfect gi@@ ft back to him, something he could look at again, something he rememb@@ ered from before that wasn't still sc@@ ar@@ red from that day in M@@ arch when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed.    
 Af@@ ter six months in J@@ ap@@ an, 1@@ ,@@ 100 volunte@@ ers had pas@@ sed through All H@@ an@@ ds, hundreds of who@@ m had helped us han@@ d-@@ clean over 1@@ 3@@ 5@@ ,000 photograph@@ s, the large maj@@ or@@ ity — — a large maj@@ or@@ ity of which did actually find their home again, import@@ ant@@ ly.    
 O@@ ver five hundred volunte@@ ers around the glo@@ be helped us get 9@@ 0 famili@@ es hundreds of photograph@@ s back, fully re@@ store@@ d and re@@ tou@@ ch@@ ed.    
 D@@ ur@@ ing this time, we ha@@ dn't really spent more than about a thous@@ and dollars in e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment and materi@@ als, most of which was prin@@ ter in@@ ks.    
 We take photos con@@ stan@@ t@@ ly.    
 A pho@@ to is a re@@ min@@ der of someone or some@@ thing, a plac@@ e, a relationshi@@ p, a loved one.    
 They're our memor@@ y@@ -@@ ke@@ e@@ per@@ s and our hi@@ stor@@ ies, the last thing we would gra@@ b and the first thing you'd go back to look for@@ .    
 That's all this project was ab@@ out, about re@@ stor@@ ing those little b@@ its of human@@ ity, giving someone that connec@@ tion back.    
 When a pho@@ to like this can be re@@ turned to someone like this, it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person recei@@ ving it.    
 The projec@@ t's also made a big difference in the lives of the re@@ tou@@ ch@@ ers.    
 For some of them, it's given them a connec@@ tion to something bigg@@ er, giving something back, using their tal@@ ents on something other than sk@@ in@@ ny model@@ s and perfect sk@@ in.    
 I would like to con@@ cl@@ u@@ de by reading an e@@ ma@@ il I got from one of them, C@@ in@@ d@@ y, the day I finally got back from J@@ ap@@ an after six month@@ s.    
 "@@ As I wor@@ ke@@ d, I couldn't help but think about the individu@@ als and the stories represent@@ ed in the imag@@ es.    
 One in particul@@ ar, a pho@@ to of women of all ag@@ es, from grand@@ mother to little girl@@ , ga@@ ther@@ ed around a b@@ ab@@ y, struc@@ k a ch@@ or@@ d, because a si@@ mil@@ ar pho@@ to from my family, my grand@@ mother and mother@@ , my@@ self, and new@@ born daugh@@ ter, han@@ g@@ s on our w@@ all.    
 A@@ c@@ ross the glo@@ be, through@@ out the ag@@ es, our basic needs are just the sam@@ e, aren't they@@ ?"    
 Thank you.       
 with this pho@@ to of a bul@@ let pi@@ er@@ c@@ ing through an app@@ le, and ex@@ pos@@ ure just a milli@@ on@@ th of a secon@@ d.    
 But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million or a billi@@ on, but one tr@@ illion f@@ r@@ am@@ es per secon@@ d.    
 I present to you a new type of photograph@@ y, fe@@ m@@ to-@@ photograph@@ y, a new imag@@ ing techniqu@@ e so fast that it can create s@@ low mo@@ tion vide@@ os of light in mo@@ tion.    
 And with that, we can create camer@@ as that can look around cor@@ n@@ ers, beyond line of si@@ ght, or see inside our body without an x@@ -@@ ra@@ y, and really challenge what we mean by a camer@@ a.    
 Now if I take a las@@ er poin@@ ter and turn it on and off in one tr@@ illi@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fe@@ m@@ to@@ secon@@ ds -- I'll create a pac@@ ket of pho@@ tons b@@ are@@ ly a milli@@ me@@ ter w@@ id@@ e.    
 And that pac@@ ket of pho@@ ton@@ s, that bul@@ le@@ t, will tra@@ vel at the spe@@ ed of li@@ ght, and again, a million times faster than an ordinary bul@@ le@@ t.    
 Now, if you take that bul@@ let and take this pac@@ ket of pho@@ tons and fire into this bo@@ tt@@ le, how will those pho@@ tons sh@@ at@@ ter into this bo@@ tt@@ le@@ ?    
 How does light look in s@@ low mo@@ tion@@ ?    
 [@@ Li@@ ght in S@@ low Mo@@ tion ... 10 B@@ illion x S@@ low@@ ] Now rememb@@ er, the whole ev@@ ent is effec@@ tively taking place in less than a n@@ an@@ o@@ second -- that's how much time it takes for light to tra@@ vel@@ .    
 But I'm s@@ low@@ ing down in this video by a fac@@ tor of 10 billi@@ on, so you can see the light in mo@@ tion.    
 But Co@@ ca@@ -@@ C@@ ol@@ a did not spon@@ s@@ or this rese@@ arch@@ . Now, there's a lot going on in this movi@@ e, so let me break this down and show you what's going on.    
 So the pul@@ se ent@@ ers the bo@@ tt@@ le, our bul@@ le@@ t, with a pac@@ ket of pho@@ tons that start tra@@ vel@@ ing through and that start sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ing insid@@ e.    
 Some of the light lea@@ ks, goes on the table, and you start seeing these ri@@ pp@@ les of wa@@ v@@ es.    
 M@@ any of the pho@@ tons even@@ tu@@ ally re@@ ach the ca@@ p and then they explo@@ de in vari@@ ous direc@@ tions.    
 As you can see, there's a bu@@ b@@ ble of air and it's boun@@ c@@ ing around insid@@ e.    
 M@@ e@@ an@@ whi@@ le, the ri@@ pp@@ les are tra@@ vel@@ ing on the table, and because of the ref@@ lec@@ tions at the top@@ , you see at the back of the bo@@ tt@@ le, after several f@@ r@@ am@@ es, the ref@@ lec@@ tions are foc@@ us@@ ed.    
 Now, if you take an ordinary bul@@ let and let it go the same di@@ stan@@ ce and s@@ low down the video -- again, by a fac@@ tor of 10 billion -- do you know how long you'll have to s@@ it here to watch that movi@@ e?    
 A day, a wee@@ k@@ ? A@@ c@@ tu@@ ally, a whole year.    
 I@@ t@@ 'll be a very bor@@ ing movie -- of a s@@ low@@ , ordinary bul@@ let in mo@@ tion.    
 And what about some sti@@ ll@@ -@@ life photo@@ gra@@ phy@@ ?    
 You can watch the ri@@ pp@@ l@@ es, again, was@@ h@@ ing over the table, the tom@@ a@@ to and the w@@ all in the back.    
 It's like th@@ row@@ ing a st@@ one in a p@@ ond of water.    
 I thou@@ ght@@ : this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo@@ , one fe@@ m@@ to f@@ r@@ ame at a time, but of course our ey@@ e se@@ es an inte@@ gra@@ l comp@@ os@@ it@@ e.    
 But if you look at this tom@@ a@@ to one more time, you will no@@ tic@@ e, as the light was@@ h@@ es over the tom@@ at@@ o, it contin@@ u@@ es to g@@ low@@ . It doesn't become dar@@ k. Why is that?    
 Because the tom@@ a@@ to is actually ri@@ p@@ e, and the light is boun@@ c@@ ing around inside the tom@@ at@@ o, and it comes out after several tr@@ illi@@ on@@ th@@ s of a secon@@ d.    
 So in the fu@@ ture, when this fe@@ m@@ to-@@ camera is in your camera ph@@ one, you might be able to go to a super@@ marke@@ t and chec@@ k if the fru@@ it is ri@@ pe without actually tou@@ ching it.    
 So how did my team at M@@ I@@ T create this camer@@ a@@ ?    
 Now, as photograph@@ ers, you know, if you take a short ex@@ pos@@ ure photo@@ , you get very little li@@ ght.    
 But we're going to go a billion times faster than your sh@@ ort@@ est ex@@ pos@@ u@@ re, so you're going to get har@@ d@@ ly any li@@ ght.    
 So what we do is we s@@ end that bul@@ let -- that pac@@ ket of pho@@ tons -- milli@@ ons of times, and rec@@ ord again and again with very cle@@ ver syn@@ ch@@ ron@@ iz@@ ation, and from the gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of dat@@ a, we compu@@ ta@@ tion@@ ally wea@@ ve together to create those fe@@ m@@ to-@@ vide@@ os I show@@ ed you.    
 And we can take all that ra@@ w data and tre@@ at it in very interesting wa@@ y@@ s.    
 So, Su@@ per@@ man can fl@@ y.    
 Some other her@@ o@@ es can become in@@ vi@@ sib@@ le.    
 But what about a new power for a future super@@ her@@ o: To see around cor@@ n@@ ers.    
 The idea is that we could sh@@ ine some light on the do@@ or, it's going to boun@@ ce, go inside the room@@ , some of that is going to ref@@ le@@ ct back on the do@@ or, and then back to the camer@@ a.    
 And we could explo@@ it these multi@@ ple boun@@ ces of li@@ ght.    
 And it's not science fic@@ tion. We have actually built it.    
 On the lef@@ t, you see our fe@@ m@@ to-@@ camer@@ a.    
 There's a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in h@@ idd@@ en behind a w@@ all, and we're going to boun@@ ce light off the do@@ or.    
 So after our pa@@ per was publi@@ sh@@ ed in N@@ atu@@ re C@@ om@@ m@@ uni@@ ca@@ tions, it was high@@ li@@ gh@@ ted by N@@ atu@@ re@@ .@@ com@@ , and they created this ani@@ ma@@ tion. R@@ am@@ es@@ h R@@ as@@ k@@ ar@@ : We're going to fire those bul@@ le@@ ts of li@@ ght, and they're going to hit this w@@ all, and because of the pac@@ ket of the pho@@ ton@@ s, they will sc@@ at@@ ter in all the direc@@ tions, and some of them will re@@ ach our h@@ idd@@ en man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in, which in turn will again sc@@ at@@ ter that li@@ ght, and again in tur@@ n, the door will ref@@ le@@ ct some of that sc@@ at@@ tered li@@ ght.    
 And a tiny f@@ rac@@ tion of the pho@@ tons will actually come back to the camer@@ a, but most interes@@ t@@ ing@@ ly, they will all arri@@ ve at a sli@@ ght@@ ly different time s@@ lo@@ t.    
   And because we have a camera that can run so fast -- our fe@@ m@@ to-@@ camera -- it has some unique ab@@ ili@@ ties.    
 It has very good time res@@ olu@@ tion, and it can look at the world at the spe@@ ed of li@@ ght.    
 And this way, we know the di@@ stan@@ c@@ es, of course to the do@@ or, but also to the h@@ idd@@ en objec@@ ts, but we don't know which point cor@@ respon@@ ds to which di@@ stan@@ ce.    
   By sh@@ ining one las@@ er, we can rec@@ ord one ra@@ w photo@@ , whi@@ ch, if you look on the scre@@ en, doesn't really make any sen@@ se.    
 But then we will take a lot of such pic@@ tures, do@@ zens of such pic@@ tures, put them together, and try to an@@ aly@@ ze the multi@@ ple boun@@ ces of li@@ ght, and from that, can we see the h@@ idd@@ en objec@@ t?    
 Can we see it in full 3@@ D@@ ?    
 So this is our re@@ construc@@ tion.    
     before we take this outside the la@@ b on the roa@@ d, but in the fu@@ ture, we could create car@@ s that a@@ vo@@ id col@@ li@@ sions with what's around the b@@ en@@ d.    
 Or we can look for survi@@ v@@ ors in ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous condi@@ tions by looking at light ref@@ lec@@ ted through open win@@ dow@@ s.    
 Or we can build end@@ os@@ cop@@ es that can see de@@ ep inside the body around oc@@ cl@@ u@@ der@@ s, and also for car@@ di@@ os@@ cop@@ es.    
 But of course, because of tis@@ su@@ e and bloo@@ d, this is quite challeng@@ ing, so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fe@@ m@@ to-@@ photograph@@ y as really a new imag@@ ing mo@@ d@@ ality to solve the next generation of health@@ -@@ imag@@ ing problem@@ s.    
 Now, like Do@@ c E@@ dg@@ er@@ t@@ on, a scienti@@ st hi@@ m@@ self, science became art -- an art of ul@@ tra@@ -@@ fast photograph@@ y.    
 And I realized that all the gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of data that we're collec@@ ting every time, are not just for scientific imag@@ ing.    
 But we can also do a new form of compu@@ ta@@ tional photograph@@ y, with ti@@ me@@ -@@ la@@ p@@ se and color co@@ d@@ ing.    
 And we look at those ri@@ pp@@ les.    
 Re@@ memb@@ er@@ : The time between each of those ri@@ pp@@ les is only a few tr@@ illi@@ on@@ th@@ s of a secon@@ d.    
 But there's also something fun@@ ny going on here.    
 When you look at the ri@@ pp@@ les under the cap@@ , the ri@@ pp@@ les are moving away from us.    
 The ri@@ pp@@ les should be moving towards us.    
 What's going on her@@ e?    
 It turns out, because we're rec@@ or@@ ding nearly at the spe@@ ed of li@@ ght, we have str@@ ange effec@@ ts, and E@@ in@@ ste@@ in would have loved to see this pic@@ ture.    
 The order at which ev@@ ents take place in the world appe@@ ars in the camera sometimes in re@@ vers@@ ed ord@@ er.    
 So by app@@ l@@ ying the cor@@ respon@@ ding space and time war@@ p, we can cor@@ rec@@ t for this di@@ stor@@ tion.    
 So whether it's for photograph@@ y around cor@@ n@@ ers, or creating the next generation of health imag@@ ing, or creating new vi@@ su@@ al@@ iz@@ a@@ tions, since our inv@@ en@@ tion, we have op@@ en@@ -@@ sour@@ c@@ ed all the data and deta@@ ils on our we@@ b@@ sit@@ e, and our hope is that the D@@ I@@ Y@@ , the creative and the research communities will show us that we should stop ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ing about the me@@ ga@@ pixel@@ s in camer@@ as -- and start foc@@ using on the next di@@ men@@ sion in imag@@ ing.    
 It's about time. Thank you.

 Let's go back to that time, to this city.    
 Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people st@@ ood up and pro@@ tes@@ ted for change.    
 This is au@@ tu@@ m@@ n 19@@ 8@@ 9@@ , and imagine that all those people standing up and pro@@ tes@@ ting for change had a mobile phone in their po@@ c@@ ke@@ t.    
 Who in the room has a mobile phone with you@@ ?    
 H@@ old it up.    
 H@@ old your ph@@ ones up, hold your ph@@ ones up@@ !    
 H@@ old it up. A@@ n An@@ dro@@ id@@ , a B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ r@@ y, w@@ ow@@ .    
 That's a lo@@ t. Al@@ most everybody today has a mobile ph@@ one.    
 But today I will talk about me and my mobile ph@@ one, and how it changed my life.    
 And I will talk about this.    
 These are 3@@ 5@@ ,@@ 8@@ 30 lin@@ es of information.    
 R@@ a@@ w dat@@ a.    
 And why are these informa@@ tions ther@@ e?    
 Because in the sum@@ m@@ er of 200@@ 6@@ , the E@@ .@@ U@@ . C@@ om@@ mis@@ sion tab@@ led a direc@@ tive.    
 This direc@@ tive [@@ is@@ ] called D@@ at@@ a R@@ et@@ ention Di@@ rec@@ tive.    
 This direc@@ tive says that each phone company in E@@ uro@@ p@@ e, each Inter@@ net ser@@ vice company all over E@@ uro@@ p@@ e, has to store a w@@ ide ran@@ ge of information about the us@@ ers.    
 Who call@@ s wh@@ om@@ ? Who sen@@ ds who@@ m an e@@ ma@@ il@@ ?    
 Who sen@@ ds who@@ m a t@@ ext messa@@ ge@@ ?    
 And if you use your mobile ph@@ one, where you are.    
 All this information is store@@ d for at least six month@@ s, up to two years by your phone company or your Inter@@ net ser@@ vice provid@@ er.    
 And all over E@@ uro@@ p@@ e, people st@@ ood up and said, "@@ We don't want this@@ ."    
 They said, we don't want this data re@@ ten@@ tion.    
 We want self-@@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation in the digital age, and we don't want that phone companies and Inter@@ net companies have to store all this information about us.    
 They were law@@ y@@ ers, jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ s, pri@@ es@@ ts, they all said@@ : "@@ We don't want this@@ ."    
 And here you can see, like 10 thousands of people went out on the stree@@ ts of B@@ er@@ l@@ in and said, "@@ F@@ re@@ ed@@ om@@ , not fear@@ ."    
 And some even said, this would be St@@ as@@ i 2@@ .@@ 0@@ .    
 St@@ as@@ i was the secre@@ t poli@@ ce in E@@ ast Ger@@ man@@ y.    
 And I also ask my@@ self, does it really work@@ ?    
 Can they really store all this information about us@@ ?    
 Every time I use my mobile ph@@ on@@ e?    
 So I asked my phone compan@@ y, D@@ e@@ ut@@ sch@@ e T@@ ele@@ k@@ om@@ , which was at that time the larg@@ est phone company in Ger@@ man@@ y, and I asked them, ple@@ as@@ e, s@@ end me all the information you have store@@ d about me.    
 And I asked them on@@ ce, and I asked them again, and I got no real answ@@ er. It was only b@@ la@@ h b@@ la@@ h answ@@ ers.    
 But then I said, I want to have this informa@@ tion, because this is my life you are pro@@ to@@ col@@ ing.    
 So I decided to start a law@@ su@@ it against them, because I wanted to have this information.    
 But D@@ e@@ ut@@ sch@@ e T@@ ele@@ k@@ om said, no@@ , we will not give you this information.    
 So at the end, I had a se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment with them.    
 I'll put down the law@@ su@@ it and they will s@@ end me all the information I ask for@@ .    
 Because in the mean time, the Ger@@ man Con@@ stitu@@ tional C@@ our@@ t rul@@ ed that the imp@@ le@@ ment@@ ation of this E@@ .@@ U@@ . direc@@ tive into Ger@@ man la@@ w was un@@ con@@ stitu@@ tion@@ al.    
 So I got this u@@ g@@ ly b@@ row@@ n en@@ velop@@ e with a C@@ .@@ D@@ . insid@@ e.    
 And on the C@@ .@@ D@@ .@@ , this was on.    
 Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ five thous@@ and eight hundred th@@ ir@@ ty lin@@ es of information.    
 At first I saw it, and I said, oka@@ y, it's a huge fi@@ le. Oka@@ y.    
 But then after a while I real@@ iz@@ ed, this is my life.    
 This is six months of my life, So I was a little bit sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ al, what should I do with it?    
 Because you can see where I am, where I sle@@ ep at night, what I am do@@ ing.    
 But then I said, I want to go out with this information.    
 I want to make them pub@@ lic@@ .    
 Because I want to show the people what does data re@@ ten@@ tion mean@@ .    
 So together with Z@@ e@@ it O@@ n@@ line and O@@ p@@ en D@@ at@@ a C@@ ity, I did this.    
 This is a vi@@ su@@ al@@ iz@@ ation of six months of my life.    
 You can z@@ oo@@ m in and z@@ oo@@ m out, you can w@@ ind back and fast for@@ war@@ d.    
 You can see every step I ta@@ k@@ e.    
 And you can even see how I go from Fran@@ k@@ f@@ ur@@ t by tra@@ in to Co@@ log@@ n@@ e, and how often I call in betwe@@ en.    
 All this is possible with this information.    
 That's a little bit sc@@ ary.    
 But it is not only about me.    
 It's about all of us.    
 Fir@@ st, it's only like, I call my wi@@ fe and she call@@ s me, and we talk to each other a couple of times.    
 And then there are some friends call@@ ing me, and they call each other.    
 And after a while you are call@@ ing you, and you are call@@ ing you, and you have this great communi@@ cation net@@ work.    
 But you can see how your people are communic@@ ating with each other@@ , what times they call each other@@ , when they go to be@@ d.    
 You can see all of this.    
 You can see the hu@@ b@@ s, like who are the lead@@ ers in the grou@@ p.    
 If you have acc@@ ess to this informa@@ tion, you can see what your society is do@@ ing.    
 If you have acc@@ ess to this informa@@ tion, you can control your societ@@ y.    
 This is a bl@@ u@@ ep@@ rin@@ t for countries like Chin@@ a and I@@ ran@@ .    
 This is a bl@@ u@@ ep@@ rin@@ t how to sur@@ v@@ ey your societ@@ y, because you know who tal@@ ks to wh@@ om@@ , who sen@@ ds who@@ m an e@@ ma@@ il, all this is possible if you have acc@@ ess to this information.    
 And this information is store@@ d for at least six months in E@@ uro@@ p@@ e, up to two years.    
 Li@@ ke I said at the begin@@ ning, imagine that all those people on the stree@@ ts of B@@ er@@ l@@ in in au@@ tu@@ m@@ n of 19@@ 8@@ 9 had a mobile phone in their po@@ c@@ ke@@ t.    
 And the St@@ as@@ i would have known who took part at this pro@@ tes@@ t, and if the St@@ as@@ i would have known who are the lead@@ ers behind it, this may never have happen@@ ed.    
 The f@@ all of the B@@ er@@ l@@ in W@@ all would maybe not [@@ have be@@ en@@ ] there.    
 And in the af@@ ter@@ ma@@ th, also not the f@@ all of the I@@ r@@ on C@@ ur@@ tain@@ .    
 Because today, state ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us, online and off@@ lin@@ e.    
 They want to have the possib@@ ility to tr@@ ack our liv@@ es, and they want to store them for all time.    
 But self-@@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation and living in the digital age is no con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tion.    
 But you have to fi@@ ght for your self-@@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation today.    
 You have to fi@@ ght for it every day.    
 So, when you go hom@@ e, that pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y is a value of the 2@@ 1@@ st centur@@ y, and it's not out@@ dat@@ ed.    
 When you go hom@@ e, tell your represent@@ ative only because companies and state ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es have the possib@@ ility to store certain informa@@ tion, they don't have to do it.    
 And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company what information they store about you.    
 So, in the fu@@ ture, every time you use your mobile ph@@ one, let it be a re@@ min@@ der to you that you have to fi@@ ght for self-@@ de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation in the digital age.    
 Thank you.    
 H@@ el@@ lo@@ , TED@@ W@@ om@@ en, what's up.    
   Not good enou@@ gh@@ .    
 H@@ el@@ lo@@ , TED@@ W@@ om@@ en, what is up@@ ?    
   My name is Ma@@ y@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id@@ , and I am not d@@ run@@ k, but the doctor who deli@@ ver@@ ed me was@@ .    
 He c@@ ut my mo@@ m six different times in six different direc@@ tions, su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ating po@@ or little me in the proc@@ ess.    
 As a resul@@ t, I have cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l p@@ al@@ s@@ y, which means I sha@@ ke all the time.    
 L@@ oo@@ k.    
 It's ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ing.    
 I'm like S@@ ha@@ ki@@ ra@@ , S@@ ha@@ k@@ ir@@ a me@@ e@@ ts M@@ u@@ ha@@ m@@ ma@@ d A@@ li@@ .    
   C@@ P is not gene@@ tic.    
 It's not a bir@@ th de@@ fec@@ t. You can't cat@@ ch it.    
 No one put a cur@@ se on my mother@@ 's u@@ ter@@ us, and I didn't get it because my parents are first cou@@ sin@@ s, which they are.    
   It only happens from acc@@ id@@ ents, like what happened to me on my bir@@ th day.    
 Now, I must war@@ n you, I'm not inspi@@ ra@@ tion@@ al.    
 And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me, because at some point in your life, you have dre@@ am@@ t of being disab@@ le@@ d.    
 C@@ ome on a jour@@ ney with me.    
 It's Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as E@@ ve, you're at the m@@ all, you're dri@@ ving around in cir@@ cl@@ es looking for par@@ king, and what do you see@@ ?    
 Si@@ x@@ te@@ en emp@@ ty han@@ di@@ ca@@ pped spac@@ es. And you're like, "@@ Go@@ d, can't I just be a little disab@@ le@@ d@@ ?"    
   Al@@ so, I've got to tell you, I've got 9@@ 9 problem@@ s, and p@@ al@@ s@@ y is just one.    
  If there was an O@@ pp@@ res@@ sion O@@ ly@@ mp@@ ic@@ s, I would win the go@@ ld me@@ d@@ al.    
 I'm P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an, M@@ us@@ li@@ m, I'm fe@@ mal@@ e, I'm disab@@ le@@ d, and I live in New J@@ er@@ se@@ y.    
    If you don't feel better about your@@ self, maybe you sh@@ oul@@ d.    
  C@@ li@@ ff@@ side Par@@ k, New J@@ er@@ se@@ y is my home@@ tow@@ n.    
 I have always loved the fact that my hood and my aff@@ lic@@ tion share the same initi@@ als.    
 I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York C@@ ity, I cou@@ l@@ d.    
 A lot of people with C@@ P don't wal@@ k, but my parents didn't believe in "@@ can@@ '@@ t@@ ."    
 My father@@ 's man@@ tr@@ a was, "@@ You can do it, y@@ es you can can@@ ."    
   So, if my three ol@@ der sist@@ ers were m@@ op@@ p@@ ing, I was m@@ op@@ p@@ ing.    
 If my three ol@@ der sist@@ ers went to public school, my parents would su@@ e the school system and gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that I went to@@ o, and if we didn't all get A@@ '@@ s, we all got my mother@@ 's sli@@ p@@ per@@ .    
   My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by plac@@ ing my he@@ el@@ s on his fe@@ et and just wal@@ king.    
 A@@ no@@ ther t@@ ac@@ tic that he used is he would dang@@ le a dol@@ lar b@@ ill in front of me and have me cha@@ se it.    
   My inner stri@@ pp@@ er was very str@@ ong@@ .    
   No, by the first day of kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ t@@ en, I was walking like a cha@@ m@@ p who had been p@@ un@@ ched one too many times.    
 G@@ row@@ ing up, there were only six Ar@@ ab@@ s in my tow@@ n, and they were all my famil@@ y.    
 Now there are 20 Ar@@ ab@@ s in tow@@ n, and they are still all my famil@@ y. I don't think anyone even no@@ tic@@ ed we weren't Ital@@ i@@ an.    
    This was before 9@@ /@@ 1@@ 1 and before poli@@ tici@@ ans thought it was appro@@ pri@@ ate to use "I h@@ ate M@@ us@@ lim@@ s@@ " as a camp@@ a@@ ign s@@ log@@ an.    
 The people that I grew up with had no problem with my fa@@ i@@ th.    
 They di@@ d, ho@@ we@@ ver, seem very con@@ cer@@ ned that I would star@@ ve to death during R@@ ama@@ d@@ an.    
 I would explain to them that I have enough f@@ at to live off of for three whole month@@ s, so fa@@ sting from sun@@ ri@@ se to sun@@ set is a piece of ca@@ k@@ e.    
  I have ta@@ p@@ -@@ danc@@ ed on B@@ ro@@ ad@@ way.    
 Yea@@ h, on B@@ ro@@ ad@@ way. It's craz@@ y. My parents couldn't aff@@ ord physical ther@@ ap@@ y, so they sent me to danc@@ ing school.    
 I learned how to d@@ ance in he@@ el@@ s, which means I can walk in he@@ el@@ s.    
 And I'm from J@@ er@@ se@@ y, and we are really con@@ cer@@ ned with being ch@@ ic, so if my friends wor@@ e he@@ el@@ s, so did I@@ .    
 And when my friends went and spent their sum@@ m@@ er va@@ cations on the J@@ er@@ se@@ y Sh@@ ore@@ , I did no@@ t.    
 I spent my sum@@ m@@ ers in a wa@@ r z@@ one, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to P@@ al@@ est@@ ine every single sum@@ m@@ er, we@@ 'd grow up to be M@@ ad@@ on@@ n@@ a.    
   S@@ um@@ m@@ er va@@ cations often con@@ sist@@ ed of my father trying to he@@ al me, so I d@@ ran@@ k de@@ er@@ 's mil@@ k, I had ho@@ t cu@@ ps on my back, I was d@@ un@@ ked in the D@@ ea@@ d S@@ ea@@ , and I remember the water bur@@ ning my ey@@ es and thinking, "@@ It's work@@ ing@@ ! It's work@@ ing@@ !@@ "    
   But one mirac@@ le cu@@ re we did find was y@@ o@@ ga@@ .    
 I have to tell you, it's very bor@@ ing, but before I did y@@ o@@ ga@@ , I was a stan@@ d-@@ up com@@ edi@@ an who can't stand up.    
 And now I can stand on my hea@@ d.    
 My parents re@@ infor@@ c@@ ed this no@@ tion that I could do any@@ thing, that no dream was impos@@ sib@@ le, and my dream was to be on the day@@ time so@@ a@@ p oper@@ a "@@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al H@@ osp@@ it@@ al@@ ."    
  I went to colle@@ ge during aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive ac@@ tion and got a s@@ we@@ et sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship to A@@ S@@ U@@ , A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a St@@ ate U@@ ni@@ vers@@ ity, because I fit every single qu@@ o@@ ta@@ . I was like the pe@@ t le@@ mu@@ r of the the@@ at@@ er de@@ part@@ ment.    
 Every@@ body loved me.    
 I did all the less@@ -@@ th@@ an@@ -@@ intellig@@ ent kid@@ s' home@@ work, I got A@@ 's in all of my clas@@ s@@ es, A@@ 's in all of their clas@@ s@@ es.    
 Every time I did a scen@@ e from "The G@@ las@@ s M@@ en@@ ag@@ eri@@ e@@ ," my prof@@ ess@@ ors would we@@ ep@@ .    
 But I never got ca@@ st.    
 F@@ in@@ ally, my sen@@ i@@ or year, A@@ S@@ U decided to do a show called "@@ They D@@ ance Re@@ al S@@ low in J@@ ack@@ son@@ ."    
 It's a play about a girl with C@@ P@@ .    
 I was a girl with C@@ P@@ .    
 So I start sh@@ ou@@ ting from the ro@@ of@@ top@@ s, "I'm finally going to get a part@@ !    
 I have cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l p@@ al@@ sy@@ !    
 F@@ ree at la@@ st@@ ! F@@ ree at la@@ st@@ !    
 Thank G@@ od al@@ mi@@ ght@@ y, I'm free at la@@ st@@ !@@ "    
 I didn't get the par@@ t. S@@ her@@ ry B@@ row@@ n got the par@@ t.    
 I went rac@@ ing to the head of the the@@ at@@ er de@@ partment cr@@ ying hy@@ ster@@ ic@@ ally, like someone sho@@ t my cat@@ , to ask her wh@@ y, and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the st@@ un@@ ts.    
 I said, "@@ E@@ x@@ c@@ use me, if I can't do the st@@ un@@ ts, nei@@ ther can the charac@@ ter@@ ."    
    This was a part that I was literally born to play they gave it to a n@@ on-@@ p@@ al@@ s@@ y ac@@ t@@ res@@ s.    
 C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge was im@@ it@@ ating life.    
 Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood has a sor@@ did history of ca@@ sting ab@@ le@@ -@@ bo@@ died ac@@ tors to play disabled on@@ scre@@ en.    
 U@@ p@@ on gradu@@ at@@ ing, I moved back hom@@ e, and my first ac@@ ting gi@@ g was as an ex@@ tr@@ a on a day@@ time so@@ a@@ p oper@@ a.    
 My dream was coming tru@@ e.    
 And I knew that I would be prom@@ o@@ ted from "D@@ in@@ er D@@ in@@ er@@ " to "@@ W@@ ack@@ y B@@ est Fri@@ end@@ " in no time. But instea@@ d, I re@@ ma@@ ined a g@@ l@@ ori@@ fied piece of f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure that you could only recog@@ n@@ ize from the back of my hea@@ d, and it became cle@@ ar to me that ca@@ sting direc@@ tors didn't hi@@ re flu@@ ff@@ y, eth@@ n@@ ic, disabled ac@@ tor@@ s.    
 They only hi@@ red perfect people.    
 But there were excep@@ tions to the ru@@ le.    
 I grew up watching Wh@@ o@@ op@@ i G@@ old@@ b@@ erg@@ , R@@ o@@ se@@ an@@ ne B@@ ar@@ r@@ , E@@ ll@@ en, and all of these women had one thing in com@@ mon@@ : they were com@@ edi@@ an@@ s.    
 So I became a com@@ ic.    
    My first gi@@ g was dri@@ ving fam@@ ous com@@ ics from New York C@@ ity to show@@ s in New J@@ er@@ se@@ y, and I'll never for@@ get the face of the first com@@ ic I ever dro@@ ve when he realized that he was spe@@ e@@ ding down the New J@@ er@@ se@@ y T@@ ur@@ n@@ pi@@ ke with a ch@@ ic@@ k with C@@ P dri@@ ving him.    
   I've perfor@@ med in cl@@ u@@ b@@ s all over Ameri@@ ca, and I've also perfor@@ med in Ar@@ ab@@ ic in the M@@ iddle E@@ a@@ st, un@@ cen@@ so@@ red and un@@ cover@@ ed. Some people say I'm the first stan@@ d-@@ up com@@ ic in the A@@ ra@@ b world.    
 I never like to cla@@ i@@ m fir@@ st, but I do know that they never heard that na@@ st@@ y little ru@@ m@@ or that women aren't fun@@ n@@ y, and they find us hy@@ ster@@ ic@@ al. In 200@@ 3@@ , my bro@@ ther from another mother and father D@@ e@@ an O@@ be@@ id@@ al@@ la@@ h and I started the New York Ar@@ ab@@ -@@ American C@@ ome@@ dy F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al, now in its 10@@ th year.    
 Our goal was to change the nega@@ tive image of Ar@@ ab@@ -@@ Americ@@ ans in medi@@ a, while also re@@ min@@ ding ca@@ sting direc@@ tors that South A@@ si@@ an and A@@ ra@@ b are not syn@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous.    
   M@@ ain@@ stre@@ am@@ ing Ar@@ ab@@ s was mu@@ ch, much eas@@ i@@ er than con@@ qu@@ ering the challenge against the sti@@ g@@ m@@ a against disab@@ ility.    
 My big break came in 20@@ 10@@ .    
 I was inv@@ ited to be a gu@@ est on the ca@@ ble news show "@@ C@@ oun@@ t@@ down with K@@ e@@ ith O@@ l@@ ber@@ man@@ n@@ ."    
 I walked in looking like I was going to the prom@@ , and they sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le me into a stu@@ di@@ o and se@@ at me on a sp@@ in@@ ning, ro@@ l@@ ling cha@@ ir@@ .    
 So I looked at the st@@ age manag@@ er and I'm like, "@@ E@@ x@@ c@@ use me, can I have another cha@@ ir@@ ?"    
 And she looked at me and she w@@ ent, "@@ F@@ i@@ ve, four@@ , thre@@ e, two ..@@ ."    
 And we were liv@@ e, right?    
 So I had to g@@ ri@@ p onto the an@@ ch@@ or@@ 's des@@ k so that I wouldn't ro@@ ll off the scre@@ en during the se@@ g@@ ment, and when the inter@@ view was over@@ , I was li@@ vid@@ .    
 I had finally gotten my chance and I b@@ le@@ w it, and I knew I would never get inv@@ ited back.    
 But not only did M@@ r. O@@ l@@ ber@@ man@@ n inv@@ ite me back, he made me a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time con@@ tribu@@ tor@@ , and he ta@@ ped down my cha@@ ir@@ .    
    One fu@@ n fact I learned while on the air with K@@ e@@ ith O@@ l@@ ber@@ man@@ n was that human@@ s on the Inter@@ net are sc@@ u@@ mb@@ ag@@ s.    
 People say children are cru@@ el, but I was never made fu@@ n of as a child or an adul@@ t.    
 Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly, my dis@@ ability on the world w@@ ide we@@ b is fa@@ ir game.    
 I would look at cli@@ ps online and see com@@ ments like, "@@ Y@@ o, wh@@ y's she t@@ wea@@ kin@@ '@@ ?"    
 "@@ Y@@ o, is she re@@ tar@@ de@@ d@@ ?"    
 And my favor@@ it@@ e, "@@ P@@ o@@ or G@@ u@@ mb@@ y@@ -@@ m@@ outh ter@@ ror@@ ist@@ .    
 What does she su@@ ff@@ er from@@ ?    
 We should really p@@ ra@@ y for her@@ ."    
 One com@@ ment@@ er even sugg@@ es@@ ted that I ad@@ d my dis@@ ability to my cre@@ d@@ it@@ s: scre@@ en@@ writ@@ er, com@@ edi@@ an, p@@ al@@ s@@ y.    
 D@@ is@@ ability is as vi@@ su@@ al as rac@@ e.    
 If a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ er can't play Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é@@ , then Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é can't play a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ er.    
 The disabled are the larg@@ est — Yea@@ h, cla@@ p for that, man@@ . C@@ ome on.    
   People with disab@@ ili@@ ties are the larg@@ est min@@ or@@ ity in the world, and we are the most under@@ represent@@ ed in enter@@ tain@@ ment.    
 The doc@@ tors said that I wouldn't wal@@ k, but I am here in front of you.    
 H@@ o@@ we@@ ver, if I grew up with social medi@@ a, I don't think I would be.    
 I hope that together, we can create more posi@@ tive images of dis@@ ability in the media and in every@@ day life.    
 P@@ er@@ ha@@ ps if there were more posi@@ tive imag@@ es, it would f@@ o@@ ster less h@@ ate on the Inter@@ ne@@ t.    
 Or maybe no@@ t.    
 Maybe it still takes a v@@ il@@ la@@ ge to teach our children well.    
 My c@@ roo@@ ked jour@@ ney has taken me to some very spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular plac@@ es.    
 I got to walk the red car@@ pe@@ t f@@ lan@@ ked by so@@ a@@ p di@@ v@@ a S@@ us@@ an L@@ uc@@ c@@ i and the ic@@ on@@ ic L@@ ore@@ en Ar@@ b@@ us.    
 I got to act in a movie with A@@ da@@ m S@@ an@@ d@@ l@@ er and work with my id@@ ol@@ , the amazing D@@ a@@ ve M@@ at@@ the@@ w@@ s.    
 I tou@@ red the world as a head@@ lin@@ er on Ar@@ ab@@ s G@@ one W@@ il@@ d.    
 I was a del@@ eg@@ ate represent@@ ing the great state of New J@@ er@@ se@@ y at the 200@@ 8 DN@@ C@@ .    
 And I foun@@ ded Ma@@ y@@ so@@ on@@ 's K@@ id@@ s, a char@@ ity that hop@@ es to give P@@ al@@ est@@ ini@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e children a sli@@ ver of the chance my parents gave me.    
 But the one moment that stan@@ ds out the most was when I got -- before this moment -- But the one moment that stan@@ ds out the most was when I got to per@@ form for the man who flo@@ at@@ s like a bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ ly and st@@ ings like a be@@ e, has Par@@ kin@@ son@@ 's and sha@@ kes just like me, M@@ u@@ ha@@ m@@ ma@@ d A@@ li@@ .    
     It was the only time that my father ever saw me per@@ form liv@@ e, and I de@@ dic@@ ate this talk to his memor@@ y.    
  My name is Ma@@ y@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id@@ , and if I can can@@ , you can can@@ .    
 I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid@@ .    
 I don't know his nam@@ e, but I do know his story.    
 He lives in a small v@@ il@@ la@@ ge in sou@@ ther@@ n S@@ om@@ ali@@ a.    
 H@@ is v@@ il@@ la@@ ge is near Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u@@ .    
 D@@ rought dri@@ ves the small v@@ il@@ la@@ ge into po@@ ver@@ ty and to the br@@ ink of star@@ va@@ tion.    
 With nothing left for him there, he lea@@ ves for the big c@@ ity, in this case, Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u@@ , the cap@@ ital of S@@ om@@ ali@@ a.    
 When he arri@@ ves, there are no oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties, no job@@ s, no way for@@ war@@ d.    
 He ends up living in a t@@ ent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u@@ .    
 Maybe a year pas@@ s@@ es, no@@ thing.    
 One day, he's approach@@ ed by a g@@ ent@@ le@@ man who offer@@ s to take him to l@@ un@@ ch, then to d@@ in@@ n@@ er, to brea@@ k@@ fa@@ st.    
 He me@@ e@@ ts this dy@@ nam@@ ic group of people, and they give him a brea@@ k.    
 H@@ e's given a bit of money to buy hi@@ m@@ self some new clo@@ th@@ es, money to s@@ end back home to his famil@@ y.    
 He is intro@@ duc@@ ed to this young wom@@ an.    
 He even@@ tu@@ ally gets mar@@ ri@@ ed.    
 He starts this new life.    
 He has a pur@@ p@@ ose in life.    
 One beautiful day in Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u@@ , under an az@@ ure bl@@ ue sk@@ y, a car b@@ om@@ b goes off.    
 That small town kid with the big city dre@@ ams was the suic@@ ide b@@ om@@ b@@ er, and that dy@@ nam@@ ic group of people were al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ ab@@ , a ter@@ ror@@ ist organ@@ iz@@ ation lin@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ e@@ da@@ .    
 So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him b@@ low@@ ing hi@@ m@@ self up@@ ?    
 He was wa@@ it@@ ing.    
 He was wa@@ iting for an opportun@@ ity, wa@@ iting to begin his fu@@ ture, wa@@ iting for a way for@@ war@@ d, and this was the first thing that came al@@ ong@@ .    
 This was the first thing that pul@@ led him out of what we call wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d.    
 in ur@@ b@@ an cent@@ ers around the world.    
 It is the story of the di@@ sen@@ f@@ ran@@ chi@@ se@@ d, u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ yed ur@@ b@@ an you@@ th who sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ o@@ ts in Jo@@ han@@ n@@ es@@ bur@@ g, sp@@ ar@@ ks ri@@ o@@ ts in L@@ on@@ don@@ , who reach@@ es out for something other than wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d.    
 For young people, the prom@@ ise of the c@@ ity, the big city dream is that of opportun@@ ity, of job@@ s, of we@@ al@@ th, but young people are not sh@@ aring in the pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity of their ci@@ ties.    
 O@@ f@@ ten it's you@@ th who su@@ ff@@ er from the high@@ est u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment r@@ at@@ es.    
 By 20@@ 3@@ 0, three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 1@@ 8@@ .    
 If we do not inclu@@ de young people if we do not provid@@ e them oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties, the story of wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d, the g@@ at@@ e@@ way to ter@@ ror@@ ism, to viol@@ ence, to g@@ ang@@ s, will be the story of cities 2@@ .@@ 0@@ .    
 And in my city of bir@@ th, Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u@@ , 7@@ 0 percent of young people su@@ ff@@ er from u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment.    
 7@@ 0 percent don't work, don't go to school.    
 They pretty much do no@@ thing.    
 I went back to Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u last mon@@ th, and I went to vis@@ it M@@ ad@@ in@@ a H@@ osp@@ it@@ al, the hosp@@ ital I was born in.    
 I remember standing in front of that bul@@ let@@ -@@ ri@@ dd@@ en hosp@@ ital thinking, what if I had never lef@@ t?    
 What if I had been forced into that same state of wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d?    
 W@@ ould I have become a ter@@ ror@@ ist@@ ?    
 I'm not really sure about the answ@@ er.    
 My reason for being in Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u that mon@@ th was actually to h@@ ost a you@@ th lead@@ er@@ ship and entrepreneur@@ ship sum@@ m@@ it.    
 I brought together about 9@@ 0 young S@@ om@@ al@@ i lead@@ ers.    
 We s@@ at down and bra@@ in@@ stor@@ med on solu@@ tions to the biggest challeng@@ es fac@@ ing their city.    
 One of the young men in the room was A@@ d@@ en.    
 He went to uni@@ versity in Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u@@ , gradu@@ ated.    
 There were no job@@ s, no oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties.    
 I remember him telling me, because he was a colle@@ ge gradu@@ at@@ e, u@@ ne@@ mp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed, fru@@ str@@ ated, that he was the perfect target for al S@@ ha@@ ba@@ a@@ b and other ter@@ ror@@ ist organ@@ iz@@ a@@ tions, to be rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed.    
 They sou@@ ght people like him out.    
 But his story takes a different rou@@ t@@ e.    
 In Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u@@ , the biggest bar@@ ri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ ad@@ s.    
 Tw@@ enty@@ -@@ three years of ci@@ vi@@ l wa@@ r have completely des@@ tro@@ yed the road system@@ , and a mo@@ tor@@ bi@@ ke can be the eas@@ i@@ est way to get aroun@@ d.    
 A@@ d@@ en saw an opportunity and se@@ ized it.    
 He started a mo@@ tor@@ bi@@ ke compan@@ y.    
 He began ren@@ ting out mo@@ tor@@ bi@@ kes to local resid@@ ents who couldn't nor@@ m@@ ally aff@@ ord them.    
 He b@@ ought 10 bi@@ k@@ es, with the help of family and friends, and his dream is to even@@ tu@@ ally exp@@ and to several hundred within the next three years.    
 How is this story differ@@ ent@@ ?    
 What makes his story differ@@ ent@@ ?    
 I believe it is his ability to identi@@ fy and se@@ ize a new opportun@@ ity.    
 It's entrepreneur@@ shi@@ p, and I believe entrepreneur@@ ship can be the most powerful tool against wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d.    
 It em@@ pow@@ ers young people to be the cre@@ at@@ ors of the very econom@@ ic oppor@@ tu@@ ni@@ ties they are so des@@ per@@ ately see@@ king.    
 And you can tra@@ in young people to be entrepreneur@@ s.    
 I want to talk to you about a young man who att@@ ended one of my me@@ et@@ ings, Mo@@ ha@@ med Mo@@ ha@@ m@@ ou@@ d, a fl@@ or@@ ist@@ .    
 at the sum@@ m@@ it in entrepreneur@@ ship and how to be inno@@ va@@ tive and how to create a culture of entrepreneur@@ shi@@ p.    
 H@@ e's actually the first fl@@ or@@ ist Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u has seen in over 2@@ 2 years, and until rec@@ ent@@ ly, until Mo@@ ha@@ med came al@@ ong, if you wanted flow@@ ers at your we@@ dd@@ ing, you used pl@@ as@@ tic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ e@@ ts shi@@ pped from ab@@ roa@@ d.    
 If you asked some@@ one, "@@ When was the last time you saw f@@ res@@ h flow@@ er@@ s@@ ?"    
 for many who grew up under ci@@ vi@@ l war@@ , the answer would be, "@@ N@@ ever@@ ."    
 So Mo@@ ha@@ med saw an opportun@@ ity.    
 He started a lan@@ ds@@ cap@@ ing and design fl@@ or@@ al compan@@ y.    
 He created a farm right outside of Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u@@ , and started growing tu@@ li@@ ps and li@@ li@@ es, which he said could survi@@ ve the har@@ sh Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u cli@@ mat@@ e.    
 And he began deli@@ ver@@ ing flow@@ ers to we@@ dd@@ ings, creating gar@@ den@@ s at hom@@ es and busin@@ ess@@ es around the c@@ ity, and he's now working on creating Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u@@ 's first public par@@ k in 2@@ 2 years.    
 There's no public par@@ k in Mo@@ ga@@ dish@@ u@@ .    
 He wan@@ ts to create a space where famili@@ es, young people, can come together, and, as he says, sm@@ ell the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ro@@ s@@ es.    
 And he doesn't grow ro@@ ses because they use too much wat@@ er, by the way.    
 So the first step is to inspi@@ re young people, and in that room@@ , Mo@@ ha@@ me@@ d@@ 's pres@@ ence had a really pro@@ found impact on the you@@ th in that room.    
 They had never really thought about starting up a busin@@ ess.    
 The@@ y@@ 've thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O@@ , working for the govern@@ ment, but his story, his inno@@ va@@ tion, really had a strong impact on them.    
 He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportun@@ ity.    
 He em@@ power@@ ed them to believe that they could be entrepreneur@@ s, that they could be change ma@@ k@@ ers.    
 By the end of the day, they were coming up to some of the biggest challeng@@ es fac@@ ing their city.    
 They came up with entreprene@@ u@@ ri@@ al solu@@ tions to local problem@@ s.    
 So in@@ spir@@ ing young people and creating a culture of entrepreneur@@ ship is a really great st@@ ep@@ , but young people need cap@@ ital to make their ideas a real@@ ity.    
 They need exper@@ ti@@ se and ment@@ or@@ ship to gu@@ ide them in develop@@ ing and la@@ un@@ ching their busin@@ ess@@ es.    
 Con@@ ne@@ ct young people with the resour@@ ces they ne@@ ed, provid@@ e them the supp@@ ort they need to go from idea@@ tion to crea@@ tion, and you will create cat@@ aly@@ sts for ur@@ b@@ an grow@@ th.    
 For me, entrepreneur@@ ship is more than just starting up a busin@@ ess.    
 It's about creating a social imp@@ ac@@ t.    
 Mo@@ ha@@ med is not simply sel@@ ling flow@@ ers.    
 I believe he is sel@@ ling hop@@ e.    
 H@@ is Pe@@ ace Par@@ k, and that's what he call@@ s it, when it's cre@@ ated, will actually trans@@ form the way people see their city.    
 A@@ d@@ en hi@@ red stre@@ et kids to help ren@@ t out and main@@ tain those bi@@ kes for him.    
 He gave them the opportunity to es@@ cap@@ e the par@@ aly@@ sis of wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d. These young entrepreneur@@ s are having a trem@@ end@@ ous impact in their ci@@ ties.    
 So my sugg@@ es@@ tion is, turn you@@ th into entrepreneur@@ s, in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and n@@ ur@@ ture their in@@ her@@ ent inno@@ va@@ tion, and you will have more stories of flow@@ ers and Pe@@ ace Par@@ ks than of car b@@ om@@ b@@ s and wa@@ i@@ th@@ oo@@ d.    
 Thank you.    
 I was about 10 years old on a camp@@ ing tri@@ p with my da@@ d in the A@@ di@@ ron@@ d@@ ack M@@ oun@@ tain@@ s, a w@@ il@@ der@@ ness area in the nor@@ ther@@ n part of New York St@@ ate.    
 It was a beautiful day.    
 The fore@@ st was sp@@ ar@@ k@@ l@@ ing.    
 The su@@ n made the lea@@ ves g@@ low like stain@@ ed g@@ las@@ s, and if it weren't for the pat@@ h we were follow@@ ing, we could almost pret@@ end we were the first human be@@ ings to ever walk that lan@@ d.    
 We got to our camp@@ sit@@ e.    
 It was a le@@ an@@ -@@ to on a bl@@ u@@ ff looking over a cr@@ y@@ st@@ al, beautiful la@@ ke, when I discover@@ ed a hor@@ r@@ or.    
 Be@@ h@@ ind the le@@ an@@ -@@ to was a du@@ mp@@ , maybe 40 fe@@ et squ@@ are with ro@@ tting app@@ le co@@ res and bal@@ le@@ d-@@ up al@@ u@@ min@@ um f@@ o@@ il, and a de@@ ad s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er.    
 And I was ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ed, I was very an@@ gr@@ y, and I was deep@@ ly conf@@ us@@ ed.    
 The ca@@ m@@ per@@ s who were too la@@ z@@ y to take out what they had brought in, who did they think would clean up after them@@ ?    
 That question sta@@ yed with me, and it simp@@ li@@ fied a litt@@ le.    
 Who cle@@ ans up after us@@ ?    
 H@@ o@@ we@@ ver you con@@ figure or wher@@ ever you place the us, who cle@@ ans up after us in I@@ stan@@ bul@@ ?    
 Who cle@@ ans up after us in Ri@@ o or in Par@@ is or in L@@ on@@ don@@ ?    
 Here in New Yor@@ k, the D@@ e@@ partment of S@@ an@@ it@@ ation cle@@ ans up after us, to the tu@@ ne of 1@@ 1@@ ,000 tons of gar@@ b@@ age and 2@@ ,000 tons of rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ab@@ les every day.    
 I wanted to get to know them as individu@@ als.    
 I wanted to understand who takes the job@@ .    
 What's it like to wear the uni@@ form and be@@ ar that bur@@ den@@ ?    
 So I started a research project with them.    
 I ro@@ de in the truc@@ ks and walked the rou@@ tes and inter@@ view@@ ed people in offic@@ es and fac@@ ili@@ ties all over the c@@ ity, and I learned a lo@@ t, but I was still an out@@ sid@@ er.    
 I needed to go de@@ e@@ per@@ .    
 So I took the job as a s@@ an@@ it@@ ation work@@ er.    
 I didn't just ri@@ de in the truc@@ ks now. I dro@@ ve the truc@@ ks.    
 And I oper@@ ated the mechan@@ ical bro@@ om@@ s and I p@@ low@@ ed the s@@ now.    
 It was a re@@ mar@@ k@@ able pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge and an amazing edu@@ ca@@ tion.    
 Every@@ one as@@ ks about the sm@@ ell@@ .    
 It's there, but it's not as pre@@ val@@ ent as you think, and on days when it is really ba@@ d, you get used to it rather quick@@ ly.    
 The we@@ ight takes a long time to get used to.    
 I knew people who were several years on the job wh@@ ose bodies were still ad@@ ju@@ sting to the bur@@ d@@ en of be@@ aring on your body tons of tr@@ as@@ h every wee@@ k.    
 Then there's the dang@@ er.    
 A@@ cc@@ or@@ ding to the Bu@@ rea@@ u of L@@ ab@@ or S@@ ta@@ tis@@ tic@@ s, s@@ an@@ it@@ ation work is one of the 10 most danger@@ ous oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions in the countr@@ y, and I learned wh@@ y.    
 You're in and out of tra@@ ff@@ ic all day, and it's z@@ o@@ om@@ ing around you.    
 It just wan@@ ts to get past you, so it's often the mo@@ tor@@ ist is not pa@@ ying att@@ en@@ tion.    
 That's really bad for the work@@ er.    
 And then the gar@@ b@@ age itself is full of ha@@ z@@ ar@@ ds that often f@@ ly back out of the truc@@ k and do terri@@ ble har@@ m.    
 I also learned about the rel@@ ent@@ less@@ ness of tr@@ ash@@ .    
 When you step off the cur@@ b and you see a city from behind a truc@@ k, you come to understand that tr@@ as@@ h is like a for@@ ce of nature un@@ to it@@ self.    
 It never stop@@ s com@@ ing.    
 It's also like a form of re@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion or cir@@ cu@@ la@@ tion.    
 It must always be in mo@@ tion.    
 And then there's the sti@@ g@@ ma@@ .    
 You put on the uni@@ for@@ m, and you become in@@ vi@@ sible until someone is up@@ set with you for what@@ ever reason like you've bloc@@ ked tra@@ ff@@ ic with your truc@@ k, or you're taking a break too close to their hom@@ e, or you're d@@ rin@@ king co@@ ff@@ e@@ e in their d@@ in@@ er, and they will come and sc@@ or@@ n you, and tell you that they don't want you any@@ where near them.    
 I find the sti@@ g@@ m@@ a especially ir@@ on@@ ic, because I str@@ ong@@ ly believe that s@@ an@@ it@@ ation work@@ ers are the most important lab@@ or for@@ ce on the stree@@ ts of the c@@ ity, for three reas@@ on@@ s.    
 They are the first gu@@ ar@@ di@@ ans of public heal@@ th.    
 If they're not taking away tr@@ as@@ h eff@@ ici@@ ently and effec@@ tively every day, it starts to sp@@ ill out of its con@@ tain@@ ment@@ s, and the dang@@ ers in@@ her@@ ent to it thre@@ at@@ en us in very real wa@@ y@@ s.    
 Di@@ se@@ as@@ es we've had in chec@@ k for deca@@ des and cen@@ tu@@ ri@@ es bur@@ st for@@ th again and start to har@@ m us.    
 The econom@@ y needs them.    
 If we can't th@@ row out the old stuff@@ , we have no room for the new stuff@@ , so then the eng@@ ines of the econom@@ y start to sp@@ ut@@ ter when con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion is comp@@ rom@@ i@@ se@@ d.    
 I'm not adv@@ oc@@ ating cap@@ it@@ al@@ ism, I'm just poin@@ ting out their relationshi@@ p.    
 And then there's what I call our aver@@ age, necess@@ ary qu@@ o@@ ti@@ di@@ an vel@@ oc@@ ity.    
 By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemp@@ or@@ ary day and age.    
 We usually don't care for@@ , re@@ pa@@ ir@@ , cle@@ an, car@@ ry around our co@@ ff@@ e@@ e cu@@ p, our shop@@ ping b@@ ag@@ , our bo@@ t@@ tle of water.    
 We use them, we th@@ row them out, we for@@ get about them, because we know there's a work@@ for@@ ce on the other side that's going to take it all a@@ way.    
 So I want to sugg@@ est today a couple of ways to think about s@@ an@@ it@@ ation that will perhaps help am@@ e@@ li@@ or@@ ate the sti@@ g@@ m@@ a and bring them into this conversation of how to cra@@ ft a city that is sustain@@ able and human@@ e.    
 The@@ ir work, I think, is kind of lit@@ ur@@ g@@ ic@@ al.    
 They're on the stree@@ ts every day, r@@ hy@@ th@@ mic@@ ally.    
 They wear a uni@@ form in many ci@@ ties.    
 You know when to ex@@ pect them.    
 And their work le@@ ts us do our work.    
 They are almost a form of reas@@ su@@ ran@@ ce.    
 The f@@ low that they main@@ tain keep@@ s us sa@@ fe from our@@ selv@@ es, from our own dro@@ s@@ s, our ca@@ st@@ -@@ off@@ s, and that f@@ low must be main@@ tain@@ ed always no matter what@@ .    
 On the day after S@@ ep@@ te@@ mb@@ er 1@@ 1 in 200@@ 1, I heard the grow@@ l of a s@@ an@@ it@@ ation truc@@ k on the stree@@ t, and I gr@@ ab@@ bed my in@@ f@@ ant son and I r@@ an down@@ sta@@ ir@@ s and there was a man doing his pa@@ per rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing rou@@ te like he did every W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day.    
 And I tried to th@@ ank him for doing his work on that day of all days, but I started to cr@@ y.    
 And he looked at me, and he just no@@ d@@ ded, and he said, "@@ We're going to be oka@@ y.    
 We're going to be oka@@ y."    
 It was a little while later that I started my research with s@@ an@@ it@@ ation, and I met that man again.    
 H@@ is name is P@@ au@@ li@@ e, and we worked together many times, and we became good friend@@ s.    
 I want to believe that P@@ au@@ li@@ e was right.    
 But in our eff@@ ort to re@@ con@@ figure how we as a species ex@@ ist on this plane@@ t, we must inclu@@ de and take ac@@ coun@@ t of all the co@@ sts, including the very real human cost of the lab@@ or.    
 And we also would be well infor@@ med to re@@ ach out to the people who do that work and get their exper@@ ti@@ se on how do we think ab@@ out, how do we create systems around sustain@@ ability that perhaps take us from cur@@ b@@ side rec@@ y@@ cl@@ ing, which is a re@@ mar@@ k@@ able success across 40 years, across the United States and countries around the world, and lif@@ t us up to a bro@@ ad@@ er hor@@ iz@@ on where we're looking at other forms of wa@@ ste    
 that could be less@@ ened from man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ing and indu@@ stri@@ al sour@@ c@@ es.    
 M@@ un@@ ici@@ p@@ al wa@@ st@@ e, what we think of when we talk about gar@@ b@@ age, ac@@ coun@@ ts for three percent of the na@@ tion@@ 's wa@@ ste stre@@ am.    
 It's a re@@ mar@@ k@@ able sta@@ tis@@ tic.    
 So in the f@@ low of your days, in the f@@ low of your liv@@ es, next time you see someone wh@@ ose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to ac@@ knowledge them.    
 T@@ a@@ ke a moment to say th@@ ank you.    
 My work foc@@ us@@ es on the connec@@ tion of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment local condi@@ tions and tra@@ di@@ tions.    
 To@@ day I brought two recent projec@@ ts B@@ o@@ th projec@@ ts are in emerg@@ ing countri@@ es, one in E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ a and another one in T@@ uni@@ si@@ a.    
 And also they have in comm@@ on that the different an@@ aly@@ ses from different perspec@@ tiv@@ es becomes an ess@@ ential part of the fin@@ al piece of architec@@ ture.    
 The first example started with an inv@@ it@@ ation to design a multi@@ story shop@@ ping m@@ all in E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ a@@ 's cap@@ ital city A@@ dd@@ is A@@ b@@ ab@@ a.    
 And this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and my@@ self, of what we had to desig@@ n.    
 At fir@@ st, the first thing I thought was, I want to run a@@ way.    
   Af@@ ter seeing a few of these build@@ ings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big poin@@ ts.    
 Fir@@ st, these build@@ ings, they are almost emp@@ ty because they have very large shop@@ s where people cannot aff@@ ord to buy things.    
 S@@ econ@@ d, they need tons of energy to per@@ form because of the sk@@ in tre@@ at@@ ment with g@@ las@@ s that cre@@ ates he@@ at in the insid@@ e, and then you need a lot of co@@ ol@@ ing.    
 In a city where this sh@@ ouldn't happen because they have really mil@@ d wea@@ ther that ran@@ g@@ es from 20 to 2@@ 5 degre@@ es the whole year.    
 And third is that their image has nothing to do with Afri@@ c@@ a and with E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ a.    
 It is a p@@ ity in a place that has such rich culture and tra@@ di@@ tions.    
 Al@@ so during our first vis@@ it to E@@ thi@@ op@@ i@@ a, I was really cap@@ tiv@@ ated by the old mer@@ ka@@ to that is this op@@ en@@ -@@ air struc@@ ture where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day from small v@@ end@@ or@@ s.    
 And also it has this idea of the public space that us@@ es the out@@ do@@ ors to create ac@@ tiv@@ ity.    
 So I thought, this is what I really want to desig@@ n, not a shop@@ ping m@@ all.    
 But the question was how we could do a multi@@ story, contemp@@ or@@ ary building with these prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es.    
 The next challenge was when we looked at the sit@@ e, that is, in a really growing area of the c@@ ity, where most of these build@@ ings that you see in the imag@@ e, they were not there.    
 And it's also between two par@@ al@@ le@@ l stree@@ ts that don't have any connec@@ tion for hundreds of me@@ ters.    
 So the first thing we did was to create a connec@@ tion between these two stre@@ et@@ s, putting all the ent@@ ran@@ ces of the build@@ ing.    
 And this ex@@ t@@ ends with an incl@@ ined at@@ ri@@ um that cre@@ ates an op@@ en@@ -@@ air space in the building that self-@@ prote@@ c@@ ts itself with its own shape from the su@@ n and the ra@@ in.    
 And around this vo@@ id we plac@@ ed this idea of the marke@@ t with small shop@@ s, that change in each flo@@ or because of the shape of the vo@@ id@@ .    
 I also thought, how to close the build@@ ing?    
 And I really wanted to find a solu@@ tion that would respon@@ d to the local climate condi@@ tions.    
 And I started thinking about the t@@ ex@@ ti@@ le like a sh@@ ell made of concre@@ te with perfor@@ ations that would let the air in, and also the li@@ ght, but in a fil@@ tered way.    
 And then the inspi@@ ra@@ tion came from these beautiful patter@@ ns of the E@@ thi@@ op@@ ian wom@@ en@@ 's dres@@ s@@ es.    
 That they have f@@ rac@@ tal ge@@ ome@@ try proper@@ ties and this helped me to shape the whole fa@@ ca@@ de.    
 And we are building that with these small pre@@ f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ated pieces that are the win@@ dow@@ s that let the air and the light in a contro@@ l@@ led way inside the build@@ ing.    
 And this is comple@@ mented by these small co@@ lo@@ red g@@ las@@ ses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at ni@@ ght.    
 With these ideas it was not easy first to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce the develop@@ ers because they were like, "@@ This is not a shop@@ ping m@@ all. We didn't ask for that@@ ."    
 But then we all realized that this idea of the marke@@ t happened to be a lot more prof@@ it@@ able than the idea of the shop@@ ping m@@ all because basically they had more shop@@ s to sel@@ l@@ .    
 And also that the idea of the fa@@ ca@@ de was mu@@ ch, much chea@@ per@@ , not only because of the materi@@ al comp@@ ared with the g@@ las@@ s, but also because we didn't need to have air condi@@ tion@@ ing any@@ more.    
 So we created some bu@@ d@@ get sa@@ v@@ ings that we used to imp@@ le@@ ment the projec@@ t.    
 And the first imp@@ le@@ ment@@ ation was to think about how we could make the building self-@@ su@@ ffic@@ i@@ ent in terms of energy in a city that has elec@@ tri@@ city cu@@ ts almost every day.    
 So we created a huge as@@ set by plac@@ ing photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics there on the ro@@ of.    
 And then under those pan@@ el@@ s we thought about the ro@@ of like a new public space with ga@@ ther@@ ing are@@ as and bar@@ s that would create this ur@@ b@@ an o@@ as@@ is.    
 And these por@@ ch@@ es on the ro@@ of, all together they colle@@ ct the water to re@@ use for s@@ an@@ it@@ ation on the insid@@ e.    
 H@@ op@@ e@@ fully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fi@@ f@@ th flo@@ or of the construc@@ tion.    
 The second example is a ma@@ ster pl@@ an of 2@@ ,000 a@@ part@@ ments and fac@@ ili@@ ties in the city of T@@ uni@@ s.    
 And for doing such a big projec@@ t, the biggest project I've ever desig@@ ne@@ d, I really needed to understand the city of T@@ un@@ is, but also its sur@@ rou@@ n@@ d@@ ings and the tra@@ di@@ tion and cul@@ ture.    
 D@@ ur@@ ing that an@@ aly@@ sis I pa@@ id speci@@ al att@@ ention to the me@@ d@@ in@@ a that is this 1@@ ,00@@ 0@@ -year-old struc@@ ture that used to be clo@@ sed by a w@@ all, op@@ ened by tw@@ el@@ ve different g@@ ates, connec@@ ted by almost stra@@ ight lin@@ es.    
 When I went to the sit@@ e, the first design oper@@ ation we did was to ex@@ t@@ end the exist@@ ing stre@@ et@@ s, creating 1@@ 2 initi@@ al bloc@@ ks si@@ mil@@ ar in si@@ ze and charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics to the ones we have in B@@ ar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a and other cities in E@@ uro@@ pe with these cour@@ ty@@ ar@@ ds.    
 On top of that, we sel@@ ec@@ ted some str@@ at@@ e@@ gic poin@@ ts re@@ min@@ ded of this idea of the g@@ ates and connec@@ ting them by stra@@ ight lin@@ es, and this mo@@ di@@ fied this initi@@ al patter@@ n.    
 And the last oper@@ ation was to think about the c@@ ell, the small cell of the projec@@ t, like the a@@ part@@ ment, as an ess@@ ential part of the ma@@ ster plan@@ .    
 And for that I thought, what would be the best ori@@ ent@@ ation in the M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an climate for an a@@ part@@ ment@@ ?    
 And it's nor@@ th@@ -@@ sou@@ th, because it cre@@ ates a ther@@ mal difference between both sid@@ es of the house and then a natural v@@ enti@@ la@@ tion.    
 So we over@@ la@@ p a patter@@ n that makes sure that most of the a@@ part@@ ments are perfec@@ tly ori@@ ent@@ ed in that direc@@ tion.    
 And this is the result that is almost like a comb@@ in@@ ation of the E@@ uro@@ pe@@ an b@@ lo@@ ck and the A@@ ra@@ b city.    
 It has these bloc@@ ks with cour@@ ty@@ ar@@ ds, and then on the grou@@ nd flo@@ or you have all these connec@@ tions for the pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an@@ s.    
 And also it respon@@ ds to the local re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions that es@@ tab@@ lish a high@@ er den@@ s@@ ity on the u@@ pp@@ er level@@ s and a low@@ er den@@ s@@ ity on the grou@@ nd flo@@ or.    
 And it also re@@ infor@@ ces this idea of the g@@ at@@ es.    
 The volu@@ me has this connec@@ ting shape that sha@@ des itself with three different types of a@@ part@@ ments and also le@@ ts the light go on the grou@@ nd flo@@ or in a very den@@ se neighbor@@ hood And in the cour@@ ty@@ ar@@ ds there are the different fac@@ ili@@ ties, such as a g@@ y@@ m and a kin@@ d@@ erg@@ ar@@ ten and close b@@ y, a ser@@ ies of comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al [@@ spac@@ es@@ ] that bring ac@@ tiv@@ ity to the grou@@ nd flo@@ or.    
 The ro@@ of, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construc@@ tion.    
 And it's where all the neighbor@@ s, they can go up and soci@@ al@@ iz@@ e, and do ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties such as having a tw@@ o@@ -@@ k@@ il@@ ome@@ ter run in the morning, ju@@ mp@@ ing from one building to an@@ other.    
 These two exam@@ pl@@ es, they have a comm@@ on appro@@ ach in the design proc@@ ess.    
 And al@@ so, they are in emerg@@ ing countries where you can see the cities literally grow@@ ing.    
 In these ci@@ ties, the impact of architec@@ ture in people@@ 's lives of today and tom@@ or@@ row changes the local communities and econom@@ ies at the same spe@@ ed as the build@@ ings grow@@ .    
 For this reas@@ on, I see even more import@@ ance to look at architec@@ ture fin@@ ding simple but aff@@ ord@@ able solu@@ tions that en@@ han@@ ce the relationship between the community and the environment and that ai@@ m to con@@ ne@@ ct nature and people.    
 Thank you very much.    
 So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to jo@@ in the clas@@ s, and she was so imp@@ res@@ si@@ ve, as the new girl always seems to be.    
 She had v@@ ast quan@@ ti@@ ties of very sh@@ in@@ y ha@@ ir and a cu@@ te little pen@@ ci@@ l case, su@@ per strong on state cap@@ it@@ als, just a great sp@@ ell@@ er.    
 And I just cur@@ d@@ led with jealous@@ y that year, until I h@@ at@@ ched my de@@ vi@@ ous plan@@ .    
 So one day I sta@@ yed a little l@@ ate after school, a little too lat@@ e, and I l@@ ur@@ ked in the girl@@ s' ba@@ th@@ room.    
 When the co@@ ast was c@@ lear@@ , I em@@ er@@ ge@@ d, cre@@ p@@ t into the clas@@ s@@ room@@ , and took from my te@@ ac@@ her@@ 's des@@ k the gra@@ de boo@@ k.    
 And then I did it.    
 I f@@ idd@@ led with my ri@@ val@@ 's gra@@ d@@ es, just a litt@@ le, just demo@@ ted some of those A@@ '@@ s.    
 All of those A@@ '@@ s. And I got ready to re@@ turn the book to the dra@@ w@@ er, when han@@ g on, some of my other clas@@ s@@ mat@@ es had app@@ all@@ ingly good gra@@ des too@@ .    
 So, in a f@@ ren@@ z@@ y, I cor@@ rec@@ ted every@@ bod@@ y's mar@@ ks, not imagin@@ a@@ tiv@@ el@@ y.    
 I gave everybody a row of D@@ 's and I gave myself a row of A@@ '@@ s, just because I was there, you know, might as well.    
 And I am still b@@ aff@@ led by my behavi@@ or.    
 I don't understand where the idea came from@@ .    
 I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.    
 I felt great@@ .    
 I don't understand why I was never ca@@ u@@ ght.    
 I mean, it should have been so bl@@ at@@ an@@ tly obvi@@ ous.    
 I was never ca@@ u@@ ght.    
 But most of all, I am b@@ aff@@ led b@@ y, why did it bo@@ ther me so much that this little girl@@ , this tiny little girl@@ , was so good at sp@@ ell@@ ing?    
 J@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y b@@ aff@@ les me.    
 It's so myster@@ i@@ ous, and it's so per@@ v@@ as@@ i@@ ve.    
 We know b@@ ab@@ ies su@@ ff@@ er from jealous@@ y.    
 We know pri@@ mat@@ es do. B@@ lu@@ e@@ bir@@ ds are actually very p@@ r@@ one.    
 We know that jealous@@ y is the number one cause of sp@@ ous@@ al m@@ ur@@ der in the United St@@ at@@ es.    
 And ye@@ t, I have never read a study that can par@@ se to me its l@@ on@@ el@@ iness or its l@@ on@@ ge@@ v@@ ity or its g@@ ri@@ m th@@ r@@ ill@@ .    
 For that, we have to go to fic@@ tion, because the no@@ vel is the la@@ b that has stu@@ died jealous@@ y in every possible con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tion.    
 In fact, I don't know if it's an ex@@ ag@@ g@@ er@@ ation to say that if we didn't have jealous@@ y, would we even have liter@@ atu@@ re@@ ?    
 Well no fa@@ i@@ th@@ less H@@ el@@ en, no "O@@ dy@@ s@@ se@@ y."    
 No jeal@@ ous king, no "@@ Ar@@ ab@@ ian N@@ i@@ ght@@ s."    
 No S@@ ha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are.    
 There goes high school reading list@@ s, because we're lo@@ sing "@@ S@@ ound and the F@@ ur@@ y@@ ," we're lo@@ sing "@@ G@@ at@@ s@@ by@@ ," "@@ Su@@ n Al@@ so R@@ is@@ es@@ ," we're lo@@ sing "@@ M@@ ad@@ ame B@@ o@@ v@@ ar@@ y@@ ," "@@ An@@ n@@ a K@@ ."    
 No jealous@@ y, no P@@ rou@@ st. And now, I mean, I know it's fas@@ hi@@ on@@ able to say that P@@ rou@@ st has the answ@@ ers to every@@ thing, but in the case of jealous@@ y, he kind of do@@ es.    
 This year is the cent@@ en@@ ni@@ al of his ma@@ ster@@ piec@@ e, "@@ In S@@ ear@@ ch of L@@ ost T@@ i@@ me@@ ," and it's the most ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tive study of sex@@ u@@ al jealous@@ y and just re@@ gu@@ lar compe@@ ti@@ tiv@@ en@@ ess, my bran@@ d, that we can hope to ha@@ ve. And we think about P@@ rou@@ st, we think about the sen@@ tim@@ ent@@ al b@@ it@@ s, right?    
 We think about a little boy trying to get to sle@@ ep@@ .    
 We think about a ma@@ del@@ e@@ ine mo@@ ist@@ ened in la@@ v@@ end@@ er te@@ a.    
 We for@@ get how har@@ sh his vi@@ sion was@@ .    
 We for@@ get how pi@@ ti@@ less he is.    
 I mean, these are books that V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a W@@ o@@ ol@@ f said were tou@@ gh as c@@ at gu@@ t.    
 I don't know what c@@ at g@@ ut is, but let's as@@ su@@ me it's for@@ m@@ id@@ able.    
 Let's look at why they go so well together, the no@@ vel and jealous@@ y, jealous@@ y and P@@ rou@@ st.    
 Is it something as obvi@@ ous as that jealous@@ y, which bo@@ ils down into pers@@ on, des@@ i@@ re, im@@ pe@@ di@@ ment, is such a so@@ li@@ d nar@@ ra@@ tive foun@@ da@@ tion@@ ?    
 I don't know. I think it cu@@ ts very close to the b@@ one, because let's think about what happens when we feel jeal@@ ous.    
 When we feel jeal@@ ous, we tell ourselves a story.    
 We tell ourselves a story about other people@@ 's liv@@ es, and these stories make us feel terri@@ ble because they're desig@@ ned to make us feel terri@@ b@@ le.    
 As the tel@@ l@@ er of the tal@@ e and the audi@@ ence, we know just what deta@@ ils to inclu@@ de, to di@@ g that k@@ ni@@ fe in. Ri@@ ght?    
 J@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y makes us all am@@ at@@ e@@ ur no@@ ve@@ list@@ s, and this is something P@@ rou@@ st underst@@ oo@@ d.    
 In the first volu@@ me, S@@ wan@@ n@@ 's W@@ a@@ y, S@@ wan@@ n, one of the main charac@@ ters, is thinking very f@@ on@@ d@@ ly of his mi@@ st@@ res@@ s and how great she is in be@@ d, and sudden@@ ly, in the course of a few s@@ ent@@ enc@@ es, and these are P@@ rou@@ sti@@ an s@@ ent@@ enc@@ es, so they're long as ri@@ ver@@ s, but in the course of a few s@@ ent@@ enc@@ es, he suddenly re@@ co@@ ils and he real@@ iz@@ es, "H@@ an@@ g on, everything I love about this wom@@ an, somebody else would love about this wom@@ an.    
 Every@@ thing that she does that gi@@ ves me ple@@ as@@ ure could be giving somebody else ple@@ as@@ u@@ re, maybe right about now@@ ."    
 And this is the story he starts to tell hi@@ m@@ self, and from then on, P@@ rou@@ st writ@@ es that every f@@ res@@ h char@@ m S@@ wan@@ n de@@ te@@ c@@ ts in his mi@@ st@@ res@@ s, he ad@@ ds to his "@@ collec@@ tion of in@@ stru@@ ments in his pri@@ v@@ ate tor@@ ture cha@@ mb@@ er@@ ."    
 Now S@@ wan@@ n and P@@ rou@@ st, we have to adm@@ it, were no@@ tor@@ i@@ ously jeal@@ ous.    
 You know, P@@ rou@@ st@@ 's bo@@ y@@ friends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him.    
 But you don't have to be that jeal@@ ous to con@@ c@@ e@@ de that it's hard work. Ri@@ ght?    
 J@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y is ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ing.    
 It's a hun@@ gr@@ y emo@@ tion. It must be fe@@ d.    
 And what does jealous@@ y like@@ ?    
 J@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y li@@ kes information.    
 J@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y li@@ kes deta@@ il@@ s.    
 J@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y li@@ kes the v@@ ast quan@@ ti@@ ties of sh@@ in@@ y ha@@ ir@@ , the cu@@ te little pen@@ ci@@ l ca@@ se.    
 J@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y li@@ kes photo@@ s.    
 That's why In@@ st@@ ag@@ ra@@ m is such a h@@ it. P@@ rou@@ st actually lin@@ ks the language of sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship and jealous@@ y.    
 When S@@ wan@@ n is in his jeal@@ ous th@@ ro@@ es, and suddenly he's list@@ ening at do@@ or@@ ways and bri@@ bing his mi@@ st@@ res@@ s' ser@@ v@@ an@@ ts, he def@@ ends these behavi@@ or@@ s.    
 He says, "@@ You know, loo@@ k, I know you think this is re@@ pu@@ g@@ n@@ ant, but it is no different from inter@@ pre@@ ting an ancient t@@ ext or looking at a mon@@ u@@ ment@@ ."    
 He says, "@@ They are scientific inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ga@@ tions with real in@@ tel@@ lec@@ tu@@ al valu@@ e."    
 P@@ rou@@ st is trying to show us that jealous@@ y feel@@ s in@@ t@@ ol@@ er@@ able and makes us look ab@@ sur@@ d, but it is, at its cru@@ x, a qu@@ est for knowle@@ dg@@ e, a qu@@ est for tru@@ th, pain@@ ful tru@@ th, and actu@@ ally, where P@@ rou@@ st is con@@ cer@@ ne@@ d, the more pain@@ ful the tru@@ th, the better.    
 G@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ , hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation, lo@@ s@@ s: These were the a@@ ven@@ u@@ es to wis@@ dom for P@@ rou@@ st.    
 He says, "@@ A woman who@@ m we ne@@ ed, who makes us suffer@@ , e@@ lic@@ its from us a gam@@ ut of feel@@ ings far more pro@@ found and v@@ ital than a man of gen@@ i@@ us who interes@@ ts us@@ ."    
 Is he telling us to just go and find cru@@ el wom@@ en@@ ?    
 No@@ . I think he's trying to say that jealous@@ y re@@ ve@@ als us to our@@ selves.    
 And does any other emo@@ tion crac@@ k us open in this particular wa@@ y?    
 Do@@ es any other emo@@ tion re@@ ve@@ al to us our ag@@ gres@@ sion and our h@@ ide@@ ous ambi@@ tion and our enti@@ t@@ le@@ ment@@ ?    
 Do@@ es any other emo@@ tion teach us to look with such pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar in@@ ten@@ sit@@ y?    
 F@@ re@@ u@@ d would write about this lat@@ er.    
 One day, F@@ re@@ u@@ d was vis@@ ited by this very an@@ x@@ i@@ ous young man who was con@@ sum@@ ed with the thought of his wi@@ fe che@@ ating on him.    
 And F@@ re@@ u@@ d says, it's something str@@ ange about this gu@@ y, because he's not looking at what his wi@@ fe is do@@ ing.    
 Because she's bl@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ; everybody knows it.    
 The po@@ or creatu@@ re is just under s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ on for no caus@@ e.    
 But he's looking for things that his wi@@ fe is doing without no@@ tic@@ ing, un@@ in@@ ten@@ tional behavi@@ or@@ s.    
 Is she sm@@ il@@ ing too bri@@ ght@@ ly here, or did she acc@@ id@@ ent@@ ally br@@ us@@ h up against a man ther@@ e?    
 [@@ F@@ re@@ u@@ d@@ ] says that the man is be@@ coming the cu@@ st@@ o@@ di@@ an of his wi@@ fe@@ 's un@@ consci@@ ous.    
 The no@@ vel is very good on this poin@@ t.    
 The no@@ vel is very good at descri@@ bing how jealous@@ y tra@@ ins us to look with in@@ ten@@ s@@ ity but not acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y.    
 In fact, the more in@@ ten@@ sel@@ y jeal@@ ous we are, the more we become resid@@ ents of f@@ ant@@ as@@ y.    
 And this is wh@@ y, I think, jealous@@ y doesn't just pro@@ vo@@ ke us to do viol@@ ent things or il@@ leg@@ al things.    
 J@@ e@@ al@@ ous@@ y prom@@ p@@ ts us to be@@ have in ways that are w@@ il@@ d@@ ly inv@@ enti@@ ve.    
 Now I'm thinking of myself at ei@@ ght, I con@@ c@@ ed@@ e, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the new@@ s.    
 A 5@@ 2@@ -year-old Mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an woman was caught creating a fa@@ ke F@@ ace@@ book ac@@ coun@@ t from which she sent vi@@ le, h@@ ide@@ ous messa@@ g@@ es to her@@ self for a year.    
 For a year. A year.    
 And she was trying to f@@ r@@ ame her ex@@ -@@ bo@@ y@@ friend@@ 's new girl@@ fri@@ end, and I have to conf@@ ess when I heard this, I just reac@@ ted with ad@@ mi@@ ra@@ tion.    
   Be@@ cause, I mean, let's be real@@ .    
 What im@@ men@@ se, if mis@@ plac@@ ed, creativ@@ ity. Ri@@ ght?    
 This is something from a no@@ vel@@ .    
 This is something from a P@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ a H@@ i@@ gh@@ sm@@ ith no@@ vel@@ .    
 Now H@@ i@@ gh@@ sm@@ ith is a particular favorite of min@@ e.    
 She is the very br@@ illi@@ ant and bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re woman of American let@@ ters.    
 S@@ he's the au@@ th@@ or of "@@ S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ers on a T@@ ra@@ in@@ " and "The T@@ al@@ ent@@ ed M@@ r. Ri@@ ple@@ y@@ ," books that are all about how jealous@@ y, it mu@@ dd@@ les our min@@ ds, and once we're in the sp@@ here, in that real@@ m of jealous@@ y, the memb@@ ran@@ e between what is and what could be can be pi@@ er@@ c@@ ed in an instan@@ t.    
 T@@ a@@ ke T@@ om Ri@@ ple@@ y, her most fam@@ ous charac@@ ter.    
 Now, T@@ om Ri@@ ple@@ y goes from wan@@ ting you or wan@@ ting what you have to being you and having what you once ha@@ d, and you're under the flo@@ or@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds, he's answ@@ ering to your nam@@ e, he's we@@ aring your r@@ ings, emp@@ t@@ ying your b@@ ank ac@@ coun@@ t.    
 That's one way to go.    
 But what do we do@@ ? We can't go the T@@ om Ri@@ ple@@ y rou@@ t@@ e.    
 I can't give the world D@@ '@@ s, as much as I would really like to, some day@@ s.    
 And it's a p@@ ity, because we live in en@@ vi@@ ous times.    
 We live in jeal@@ ous times.    
 I mean, we're all good citi@@ zens of social medi@@ a, aren't w@@ e, where the cur@@ ren@@ c@@ y is en@@ v@@ y?    
 Do@@ es the no@@ vel show us a way out@@ ? I'm not su@@ re.    
 So let's do what charac@@ ters always do when they're not su@@ re, when they are in pos@@ ses@@ sion of a myster@@ y.    
 Let's go to 2@@ 2@@ 1@@ B B@@ ak@@ er S@@ tre@@ et and ask for S@@ her@@ lo@@ ck Hol@@ m@@ es.    
 When people think of Hol@@ m@@ es, they think of his ne@@ mes@@ is being P@@ ro@@ f@@ ess@@ or M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty, right, this cri@@ min@@ al ma@@ ster@@ min@@ d.    
 But I've always pre@@ fer@@ red [@@ In@@ spec@@ tor@@ ] L@@ es@@ tra@@ de, who is the r@@ at@@ -@@ fac@@ ed head of S@@ co@@ t@@ land Y@@ ard who needs Hol@@ m@@ es des@@ per@@ ately, needs Hol@@ mes@@ ' gen@@ i@@ us, but res@@ ents him.    
 O@@ h, it's so famili@@ ar to me.    
 So L@@ es@@ tra@@ de needs his hel@@ p, res@@ ents him, and sort of see@@ the@@ s with b@@ it@@ ter@@ ness over the course of the myster@@ ies.    
 But as they work together, something starts to chang@@ e, and finally in "The A@@ d@@ ven@@ ture of the Si@@ x Na@@ po@@ le@@ on@@ s@@ ," once Hol@@ m@@ es comes in, da@@ z@@ z@@ les everybody with his solu@@ tion, L@@ es@@ tra@@ de turns to Hol@@ m@@ es and he says, "@@ We're not jeal@@ ous of you, M@@ r. Hol@@ m@@ es.    
 We're p@@ rou@@ d of you@@ ."    
 And he says that there's not a man at S@@ co@@ t@@ land Y@@ ard who wouldn't want to sha@@ ke S@@ her@@ lo@@ ck Hol@@ mes@@ ' han@@ d.    
 It's one of the few times we see Hol@@ m@@ es moved in the myster@@ ies, and I find it very mov@@ ing, this little scen@@ e, but it's also myster@@ i@@ ous, right?    
 It seems to tre@@ at jealous@@ y as a problem of ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ y, not emo@@ tion.    
 You know, one min@@ u@@ te Hol@@ m@@ es is on the other side from L@@ es@@ tra@@ de.    
 The next min@@ u@@ te they're on the same sid@@ e.    
 Su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly, L@@ es@@ tra@@ de is le@@ tting hi@@ m@@ self ad@@ mi@@ re this mind that he's res@@ ent@@ ed.    
 C@@ ould it be so simple thou@@ gh@@ ?    
 What if jealous@@ y really is a matter of ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ y, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in rela@@ tion to an@@ other@@ ?    
 Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to res@@ ent some@@ bod@@ y's ex@@ cell@@ ence.    
 We could al@@ ign ourselves with it.    
 But I like cont@@ ing@@ ency plan@@ s.    
 So while we wa@@ it for that to happen@@ , let us remember that we have fic@@ tion for con@@ sol@@ ation.    
 F@@ ic@@ tion alone de@@ my@@ sti@@ fi@@ es jealous@@ y.    
 F@@ ic@@ tion alone domes@@ tic@@ ates it, inv@@ it@@ es it to the tab@@ le.    
 s@@ we@@ et L@@ es@@ tra@@ de, terri@@ f@@ ying T@@ om Ri@@ ple@@ y, crazy S@@ wan@@ n, M@@ ar@@ c@@ el P@@ rou@@ st hi@@ m@@ self.    
 We are in ex@@ cell@@ ent compan@@ y.    
 Thank you.    
 So, we used to solve big problem@@ s.    
 On J@@ u@@ ly 2@@ 1@@ st, 19@@ 6@@ 9@@ , Bu@@ z@@ z Al@@ d@@ r@@ in cli@@ mb@@ ed out of A@@ pol@@ l@@ o 1@@ 1@@ 's l@@ un@@ ar mo@@ du@@ le and des@@ c@@ ended onto the Se@@ a of T@@ ran@@ qu@@ ility.    
 Ar@@ m@@ strong and Al@@ d@@ r@@ in were al@@ one, but their pres@@ ence on the mo@@ on@@ 's gra@@ y sur@@ face was the cul@@ min@@ ation of a con@@ vul@@ si@@ ve, collec@@ tive eff@@ or@@ t.    
 The A@@ pol@@ l@@ o program was the greatest in the history of the United St@@ at@@ es.    
 To get to the mo@@ on, N@@ A@@ S@@ A spent around 1@@ 8@@ 0 billion dollars in to@@ da@@ y's mone@@ y, or four percent of the fe@@ der@@ al bu@@ d@@ ge@@ t.    
 A@@ pol@@ l@@ o emp@@ lo@@ yed around 4@@ 00@@ ,000 people and de@@ man@@ ded the collabor@@ ation of 20@@ ,000 comp@@ ani@@ es, univer@@ si@@ ties and government ag@@ en@@ ci@@ es.    
 People di@@ ed, including the cre@@ w of A@@ pol@@ l@@ o 1@@ .    
 But before the A@@ pol@@ l@@ o program en@@ ded, 2@@ 4 men f@@ le@@ w to the mo@@ on.    
 Tw@@ el@@ ve walked on its sur@@ fac@@ e, of who@@ m Al@@ d@@ rin@@ , follow@@ ing the death of Ar@@ m@@ strong last year, is now the most sen@@ i@@ or.    
 So why did they go@@ ?    
 They didn't bring much back@@ : 8@@ 4@@ 1 p@@ oun@@ ds of old ro@@ c@@ ks, and something all 2@@ 4 later emp@@ ha@@ si@@ zed -- a new sense of the sm@@ all@@ ness and the fra@@ g@@ ility of our comm@@ on hom@@ e.    
 Why did they go@@ ? The cy@@ ni@@ cal answer is they went because Presid@@ ent Ken@@ ne@@ dy wanted to show the S@@ o@@ vi@@ e@@ ts that his n@@ ation had the better ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ts.    
 But Ken@@ ne@@ d@@ y's own words at R@@ ice U@@ ni@@ versity in 19@@ 6@@ 2 provid@@ e a better cl@@ u@@ e.    
  Jo@@ h@@ n F@@ . Ken@@ ne@@ dy@@ : But wh@@ y, some say, the mo@@ on@@ ?    
 Why choose this as our go@@ al@@ ?    
 And they may well as@@ k, why clim@@ b the high@@ est moun@@ tain@@ ?    
 Wh@@ y, 3@@ 5 years ago, f@@ ly the A@@ t@@ lan@@ tic@@ ?    
 Why does R@@ ice play T@@ ex@@ as@@ ?    
 We choose to go to the mo@@ on.    
 We choose to go to the mo@@ on.    
   We choose to go to the mo@@ on in this deca@@ de, and do the other things, not because they are eas@@ y, but because they are har@@ d.    
 J@@ as@@ on P@@ on@@ tin@@ : To contemp@@ or@@ ari@@ es, A@@ pol@@ l@@ o wasn't only a vic@@ tor@@ y of W@@ est over E@@ ast in the C@@ old War@@ .    
 At the time, the str@@ ong@@ est emo@@ tion was of won@@ der at the tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ent pow@@ ers of technolog@@ y.    
 They went because it was a big thing to do.    
 L@@ an@@ ding on the mo@@ on oc@@ cur@@ red in the cont@@ ext of a long ser@@ ies of techno@@ logical tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s.    
 The first half of the 20@@ th centur@@ y produc@@ ed the as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly line and the air@@ plan@@ e, pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and a vacc@@ ine for tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ si@@ s.    
 In the middle years of the centur@@ y, poli@@ o was er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated and sm@@ all@@ po@@ x e@@ li@@ min@@ ated.    
 T@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ logy itself seemed to pos@@ s@@ ess what Al@@ v@@ in T@@ off@@ l@@ er in 19@@ 7@@ 0 called "@@ acc@@ el@@ er@@ ative th@@ ru@@ st@@ ."    
 For most of human hi@@ story, we could go no faster than a hor@@ se or a bo@@ at with a sa@@ il, but in 19@@ 6@@ 9@@ , the cre@@ w of A@@ pol@@ l@@ o 10 f@@ le@@ w at 2@@ 5@@ ,000 miles an hour@@ .    
 S@@ in@@ ce 19@@ 7@@ 0, no human be@@ ings have been back to the mo@@ on.    
 No one has tra@@ vel@@ ed faster than the cre@@ w of A@@ pol@@ l@@ o 10@@ , and b@@ li@@ the op@@ tim@@ ism about technolog@@ y's pow@@ ers has ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated as big problems we had imagin@@ ed technology would sol@@ ve, such as going to M@@ ar@@ s, creating clean energ@@ y, cur@@ ing can@@ c@@ er, or fe@@ e@@ ding the world have come to seem in@@ trac@@ tab@@ ly har@@ d.    
 I remember watching the lif@@ to@@ ff of A@@ pol@@ l@@ o 1@@ 7@@ .    
 I was five years old, at the fi@@ ery ex@@ ha@@ ust of a S@@ atur@@ n V ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t.    
 I v@@ ag@@ u@@ ely knew this was to be the last of the mo@@ on mis@@ sion@@ s, but I was absolutely certain there would be M@@ ars col@@ on@@ ies in my life@@ time.    
 So "@@ Some@@ thing happened to our cap@@ ac@@ ity to solve big problems with technolog@@ y@@ " has become a com@@ mon@@ plac@@ e.    
 You hear it all the time.    
 We've heard it over the last two days here at TED@@ .    
 It feel@@ s as if technologi@@ sts have di@@ ver@@ ted us and en@@ ri@@ ched themselves with tri@@ vi@@ al to@@ ys, with things like i@@ P@@ hon@@ es and app@@ s and social medi@@ a, or al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms that spe@@ ed au@@ tom@@ ated tra@@ d@@ ing.    
 There's nothing wrong with most of these things.    
 The@@ y@@ 've exp@@ an@@ ded and en@@ ri@@ ched our lives.    
 But they don't solve human@@ it@@ y's big problem@@ s.    
 What happen@@ ed@@ ?    
 So there is a par@@ o@@ ch@@ ial ex@@ plan@@ ation in Si@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y, which adm@@ its that it has been fund@@ ing less ambi@@ ti@@ ous companies Si@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y says the marke@@ ts are to bl@@ am@@ e, in particular the inc@@ enti@@ ves that ven@@ ture cap@@ it@@ al@@ ists offer to entrepreneur@@ s.    
 Si@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y says that ven@@ ture inv@@ es@@ ting shi@@ f@@ ted away from fund@@ ing trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tional ideas and towards fund@@ ing incre@@ mental problems or even fa@@ ke problem@@ s.    
 But I don't think that ex@@ plan@@ ation is good enou@@ gh@@ .    
 It mo@@ st@@ ly expla@@ ins what's wrong with Si@@ lic@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y.    
 E@@ ven when ven@@ ture cap@@ it@@ al@@ ists were at their most risk@@ -@@ happ@@ y, they pre@@ fer@@ red small inv@@ est@@ ment@@ s, tiny inv@@ est@@ ments that offer@@ ed an ex@@ it within 10 years.    
 V@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ s have always stru@@ gg@@ led to inv@@ est prof@@ it@@ ably in technologi@@ es such as energy wh@@ ose cap@@ ital re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments are huge and wh@@ ose development is long and l@@ eng@@ th@@ y, and V@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ s have ne@@ ver, never fund@@ ed the development of technologi@@ es me@@ ant to solve big problems that pos@@ s@@ ess no im@@ medi@@ ate comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al valu@@ e.    
 No, the reas@@ ons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more prof@@ oun@@ d.    
 Some@@ times we choose not to solve big problem@@ s.    
 We could go to M@@ ars if we wan@@ t.    
 N@@ A@@ S@@ A even has the out@@ line of a plan@@ .    
 But going to M@@ ars would follow a political deci@@ sion with pop@@ ular appe@@ al, and that will never happen@@ .    
 We won@@ 't go to M@@ ar@@ s, because everyone thin@@ ks there are more important things to do here on Ear@@ th.    
 Some@@ times, we can't solve big problems because our political systems fail@@ .    
 To@@ day, less than two percent of the world@@ 's energy con@@ su@@ mp@@ tion der@@ i@@ ves from adv@@ anc@@ ed, re@@ new@@ able sour@@ ces such as sol@@ ar, w@@ ind and bio@@ fuel@@ s, less than two perc@@ ent, and the reason is pu@@ rely econom@@ ic.    
 Co@@ al and natural g@@ as are chea@@ per than sol@@ ar and win@@ d, and pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um is chea@@ per than bio@@ fuel@@ s.    
 We want alter@@ na@@ tive energy sour@@ ces that can compe@@ te on pri@@ ce. N@@ one exist@@ .    
 Now, technologi@@ sts, business lead@@ ers and econom@@ ists all basically ag@@ ree on what national poli@@ ci@@ es and inter@@ national t@@ rea@@ ties would sp@@ ur the development of alter@@ na@@ tive energ@@ y@@ : mo@@ st@@ ly, a signific@@ ant increase in energy research and develop@@ ment, and some kind of pri@@ ce on car@@ b@@ on.    
 But there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy polic@@ y or inter@@ national t@@ rea@@ ties that ref@@ le@@ ct that con@@ sen@@ s@@ us.    
 Some@@ times, big problems that had seemed techno@@ logical turn out not to be so@@ .    
 F@@ am@@ ines were long underst@@ ood to be ca@@ used by fail@@ u@@ res in food supp@@ ly.    
 But 30 years of research have taught us that fam@@ ines are political cri@@ ses that cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ ph@@ ically affec@@ t food di@@ stri@@ bu@@ tion.    
 T@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ logy can impro@@ ve things like c@@ ro@@ p y@@ i@@ el@@ ds or systems for stor@@ ing and transp@@ or@@ ting food, but there will be fam@@ ines so long as there are bad govern@@ ment@@ s.    
 F@@ in@@ ally, big problems sometimes el@@ u@@ de solu@@ tion because we don't really understand the problem.    
 Presid@@ ent N@@ i@@ x@@ on dec@@ la@@ red wa@@ r on can@@ c@@ er in 19@@ 7@@ 1, but we soon discover@@ ed there are many kinds of can@@ c@@ er, most of them fi@@ en@@ dish@@ ly re@@ sist@@ ant to ther@@ ap@@ y, and it is only in the last 10 years that effec@@ tive, vi@@ able ther@@ a@@ pi@@ es have come to seem real@@ .    
 H@@ ard problems are har@@ d.    
 It's not tru@@ e that we can't solve big problems through technolog@@ y.    
 We can@@ , we mu@@ st, but these four el@@ em@@ ents must all be present@@ : P@@ o@@ li@@ tical lead@@ ers and the public must care to solve a problem@@ ; in@@ stitu@@ tions must supp@@ ort its solu@@ tion@@ ; It must really be a techno@@ logical problem@@ ; and we must understand it.    
 The A@@ pol@@ l@@ o mis@@ sion, which has become a kind of me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or for technolog@@ y's cap@@ ac@@ ity to solve big problem@@ s, met these cr@@ it@@ eri@@ a.    
 But it is an ir@@ re@@ pro@@ du@@ ci@@ ble model for the fu@@ ture.    
 It is not 19@@ 6@@ 1@@ .    
 There is no g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ izing cont@@ est like the C@@ old W@@ ar, no poli@@ tici@@ an like Jo@@ h@@ n Ken@@ ne@@ dy who can her@@ o@@ ize the difficult and the danger@@ ous, and no pop@@ ular science fic@@ tional my@@ tho@@ logy such as explor@@ ing the sol@@ ar system.    
 M@@ ost of all, going to the mo@@ on turned out to be eas@@ y.    
 It was just three days a@@ way.    
 And argu@@ ably it wasn't even sol@@ ving much of a problem.    
 We are left alone with our day, and the solu@@ tions of the future will be har@@ der w@@ on.    
 G@@ od know@@ s, we don't l@@ ack for the challeng@@ es.    
 Thank you very much.    
 So I'm going to talk about tru@@ st, and I'm going to start by re@@ min@@ ding you of the stand@@ ard view@@ s that people have about tru@@ st.    
 I think these are so com@@ mon@@ plac@@ e, they@@ 've become cli@@ ch@@ é@@ s of our societ@@ y.    
 And I think there are thre@@ e.    
 O@@ ne@@ 's a cla@@ im@@ : there has been a great de@@ cl@@ ine in tru@@ st, very w@@ id@@ ely believ@@ ed.    
 The second is an a@@ im@@ : we should have more tru@@ st.    
 And the third is a t@@ as@@ k@@ : we should re@@ build tru@@ st.    
 I think that the cla@@ im@@ , the ai@@ m and the t@@ ask are all mis@@ con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ ed.    
 So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a cla@@ im@@ , an ai@@ m and a t@@ ask which I think give one quite a lot better pur@@ cha@@ se on the mat@@ ter.    
 Fir@@ st the cla@@ im@@ : Why do people think trust has de@@ cl@@ in@@ ed@@ ?    
 And if I really think about it on the bas@@ is of my own ev@@ id@@ ence, I don't know the answ@@ er.    
 I'm incl@@ ined to think it may have de@@ cl@@ ined in some ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties or some in@@ stitu@@ tions and it might have grow@@ n in other@@ s.    
 I don't have an over@@ view@@ .    
 But, of course, I can look at the opini@@ on pol@@ l@@ s, and the opini@@ on pol@@ ls are su@@ p@@ po@@ se@@ d@@ ly the sour@@ ce of a beli@@ ef that trust has de@@ cl@@ in@@ ed.    
 When you actually look at opini@@ on pol@@ ls across time, there's not much evidence for that.    
 That's to say, the people who were mi@@ stru@@ sted 20 years ago, prin@@ ci@@ p@@ ally jour@@ nal@@ ists and poli@@ tici@@ an@@ s, are still mi@@ stru@@ st@@ ed.    
 And the people who were high@@ ly trust@@ ed 20 years ago are still rather high@@ ly trust@@ ed@@ : judg@@ es, n@@ ur@@ s@@ es.    
 The rest of us are in betwe@@ en, and by the way, the average person in the stre@@ et is almost exactly m@@ id@@ way.    
 But is that good ev@@ id@@ enc@@ e?    
 What opini@@ on pol@@ ls rec@@ ord is, of course, opini@@ on@@ s.    
 What else can they rec@@ ord@@ ?    
 So they're looking at the gener@@ ic at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des that people repor@@ t when you ask them certain ques@@ tions. Do you trust poli@@ tici@@ ans@@ ? Do you trust te@@ ac@@ her@@ s?    
 Now if somebody said to you, "@@ Do you trust gre@@ eng@@ ro@@ cer@@ s?    
 Do you trust fish@@ mon@@ g@@ er@@ s?    
 Do you trust el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school te@@ ac@@ her@@ s@@ ?"    
 you would probably begin by say@@ ing, "@@ To do what@@ ?"    
 And that would be a perfec@@ tly sen@@ sible respon@@ se.    
 And you might say, when you underst@@ ood the answer to that, "Well, I trust some of them, but not other@@ s."    
 That's a perfec@@ tly ra@@ tional thing.    
 In shor@@ t, in our real liv@@ es, we see@@ k to place trust in a differ@@ enti@@ ated way.    
 We don't make an as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion that the level of trust that we will have in every instan@@ ce of a certain type of offic@@ ial or offic@@ e-@@ hol@@ der or type of person is going to be uni@@ for@@ m.    
 I mi@@ ght, for example, say that I certainly trust a certain el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary school te@@ ac@@ her I know to teach the rec@@ ep@@ tion class to rea@@ d, but in no way to dri@@ ve the school min@@ i@@ b@@ us.    
 I mi@@ ght, after all, know that she wasn't a good dri@@ ver.    
 I might trust my most lo@@ qu@@ ac@@ i@@ ous friend to keep a conversation going but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secre@@ t.    
 S@@ imp@@ le.    
 So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differ@@ enti@@ ated, why do we sort of dro@@ p all that intellig@@ ence when we think about trust more ab@@ str@@ ac@@ t@@ l@@ y?    
 I think the pol@@ ls are very bad gu@@ id@@ es to the level of trust that actually exist@@ s, because they try to ob@@ liter@@ ate the good judg@@ ment that goes into plac@@ ing tru@@ st.    
 S@@ econ@@ d@@ ly, what about the a@@ im@@ ?    
 The ai@@ m is to have more tru@@ st.    
 Well f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly, I think that's a stu@@ pi@@ d a@@ im@@ .    
 It's not what I would ai@@ m at.    
 I would ai@@ m to have more trust in the trustworth@@ y but not in the un@@ trustworth@@ y.    
 In fact, I ai@@ m posi@@ tively to try not to trust the un@@ trustworth@@ y.    
 And I think, of those people wh@@ o, for example, plac@@ ed their sa@@ v@@ ings with the very ap@@ tly nam@@ ed M@@ r. Ma@@ do@@ ff@@ , who then made off with them, and I think of them, and I think, well, y@@ es, too much tru@@ st.    
 M@@ or@@ e trust is not an intellig@@ ent ai@@ m in this life.    
 In@@ tellig@@ ently plac@@ ed and intellig@@ ently ref@@ used trust is the pro@@ per a@@ im@@ .    
 Well once one says that, one says, yea@@ h, oka@@ y, that means that what mat@@ ters in the first place is not trust but trustwor@@ thin@@ ess.    
 It's judg@@ ing how trustworth@@ y people are in particular res@@ pec@@ ts.    
 And I think that judg@@ ment re@@ qui@@ res us to look at three things.    
 Are they compe@@ t@@ ent@@ ? Are they hon@@ est@@ ? Are they reli@@ ab@@ le@@ ?    
 And if we find that a person is compe@@ t@@ ent in the rele@@ v@@ ant mat@@ ters, and reli@@ able and hon@@ es@@ t, we@@ 'll have a pretty good reason to trust them, because they@@ 'll be trustworth@@ y.    
 But i@@ f@@ , on the other han@@ d, they're un@@ reli@@ able, we might no@@ t.    
 I have friends who are compe@@ t@@ ent and hon@@ es@@ t, but I would not trust them to p@@ ost a let@@ ter, I have friends who are very conf@@ id@@ ent they can do certain things, but I realize that they over@@ es@@ tim@@ ate their own compe@@ t@@ ence.    
 And I'm very g@@ la@@ d to say, I don't think I have many friends who are compe@@ t@@ ent and reli@@ able but ex@@ trem@@ ely dish@@ on@@ es@@ t.    
   If so, I haven't yet s@@ pot@@ ted it.    
 But that's what we're looking for@@ : trustwor@@ thin@@ ess before tru@@ st.    
 T@@ r@@ ust is the respon@@ se.    
 T@@ ru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess is what we have to judg@@ e.    
 And, of course, it's diffic@@ ul@@ t.    
 A@@ c@@ ross the last few deca@@ d@@ es, we've tried to construc@@ t systems of ac@@ coun@@ tab@@ ility for all sorts of in@@ stitu@@ tions and prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als and offic@@ i@@ als and so on that will make it eas@@ i@@ er for us to judge their trustwor@@ thin@@ ess.    
 A lot of these systems have the conver@@ se effec@@ t.    
 They don't work as they're supposed to.    
 I remember I was talking with a m@@ id@@ wi@@ fe who said, "Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer to do the pa@@ per@@ work than to deli@@ ver the b@@ ab@@ y."    
 And all over our public life, our in@@ stitu@@ tional life, we find that proble@@ m, that is me@@ ant to se@@ cu@@ re trustwor@@ thin@@ ess and evidence of trustwor@@ thin@@ ess is actually doing the op@@ pos@@ it@@ e.    
 It is di@@ str@@ ac@@ ting people who have to do difficult t@@ as@@ ks, like m@@ id@@ wi@@ ves, from doing them by re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing them to tic@@ k the bo@@ x@@ es, as we sa@@ y.    
 You can all give your own exam@@ ples there.    
 So so much for the a@@ im@@ .    
 The a@@ im@@ , I think, is more trustwor@@ thin@@ ess, and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworth@@ y and communic@@ ate our trustwor@@ thin@@ ess to other people, and if we are trying to judge whether other people or offic@@ e-@@ hol@@ d@@ ers or poli@@ tici@@ ans are trustworth@@ y.    
 It's not eas@@ y. It is judg@@ ment, and simple reac@@ tion, at@@ ti@@ tu@@ d@@ es, don't do a@@ de@@ qu@@ ately here.    
 Now th@@ ir@@ d@@ ly, the t@@ as@@ k.    
 C@@ all@@ ing the t@@ ask re@@ building tru@@ st, I think, also gets things back@@ war@@ ds.    
 It sugg@@ es@@ ts that you and I should re@@ build tru@@ st.    
 Well, we can do that for our@@ selves.    
 We can re@@ build a bit of trustwor@@ thin@@ ess.    
 We can do it two people together trying to impro@@ ve tru@@ st.    
 But tru@@ st, in the end, is dist@@ inc@@ tive because it's given by other people.    
 You can't re@@ build what other people give you.    
 You have to give them the bas@@ is for giving you their tru@@ st.    
 So you have to, I think, be trustworth@@ y.    
 And that, of course, is because you can't f@@ ool all of the people all of the time, usu@@ ally.    
 But you also have to provid@@ e us@@ able evidence that you are trustworth@@ y.    
 How to do it?    
 Well every day, all over the plac@@ e, it's being done by ordinary people, by offic@@ i@@ als, by in@@ stitu@@ tions, quite effec@@ tiv@@ el@@ y.    
 L@@ et me give you a simple comm@@ er@@ ci@@ al examp@@ le.    
 The sho@@ p where I buy my so@@ c@@ ks says I may take them back, and they don't ask any ques@@ tions.    
 They take them back and give me the money or give me the pa@@ ir of so@@ c@@ ks of the color I wan@@ ted.    
 That's super@@ . I trust them because they have made themselves vul@@ ner@@ able to me.    
 I think there's a big less@@ on in that.    
 If you make your@@ self vul@@ ner@@ able to the other part@@ y, then that is very good evidence that you are trustworth@@ y and you have conf@@ idence in what you are say@@ ing.    
 So in the end, I think what we are a@@ im@@ ing for is not very difficult to disc@@ er@@ n.    
 It is relationshi@@ ps in which people are trustworth@@ y and can judge when and how the other person is trustworth@@ y. So the mor@@ al of all this is, we need to think much less about tru@@ st, let alone about at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des of trust de@@ te@@ c@@ ted or mis@@ -@@ de@@ te@@ c@@ ted by opini@@ on pol@@ l@@ s, much more about being trustworth@@ y, and how you give people a@@ de@@ qu@@ at@@ e, us@@ e@@ ful and simple evidence that you're trustworth@@ y.    
 Th@@ an@@ ks.    
 Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out the history of compu@@ ters we've been stri@@ ving to sh@@ ort@@ en the ga@@ p between us and digital informa@@ tion, the ga@@ p between our physical world and the world in the scre@@ en where our imagin@@ ation can go w@@ il@@ d.    
 And this ga@@ p has become shor@@ ter, shor@@ ter, and even shor@@ ter, and now this ga@@ p is sh@@ ort@@ ened down to less than a milli@@ me@@ ter, the th@@ ic@@ k@@ ness of a tou@@ ch@@ -@@ scre@@ en g@@ las@@ s, and the power of compu@@ ting has become acc@@ es@@ sible to every@@ one.    
 But I wonder@@ ed, what if there could be no boun@@ d@@ ary at all@@ ?    
 I started to imagine what this would look lik@@ e.    
 Fir@@ st, I created this tool which p@@ ene@@ tr@@ ates into the digital space, so when you pres@@ s it hard on the scre@@ en, it trans@@ f@@ ers its physical body into pixel@@ s.    
 D@@ es@@ ig@@ n@@ ers can materi@@ al@@ ize their ideas direc@@ tly in 3@@ D@@ , and sur@@ ge@@ ons can prac@@ tice on virtu@@ al org@@ ans under@@ ne@@ ath the scre@@ en.    
 So with this tool@@ , this boun@@ d@@ ary has been bro@@ k@@ en.    
 But our two hands still re@@ main outside the scre@@ en.    
 How can you re@@ ach inside and inter@@ act with the digital information using the full d@@ ex@@ ter@@ ity of our hand@@ s?    
 At M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft A@@ pp@@ li@@ ed S@@ ci@@ enc@@ es, along with my ment@@ or C@@ at@@ i B@@ ou@@ lan@@ g@@ er, I re@@ desig@@ ned the computer and turned a little space abo@@ ve the ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard into a digital work@@ spac@@ e.    
 By comb@@ ining a transp@@ aren@@ t disp@@ la@@ y and dep@@ th camer@@ as for sen@@ sing your fing@@ ers and fac@@ e, now you can lif@@ t up your hands from the ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard and re@@ ach inside this 3@@ D space and gra@@ b pixel@@ s with your b@@ are han@@ ds.    
   Because win@@ dow@@ s and fil@@ es have a posi@@ tion in the real space, sel@@ ec@@ ting them is as easy as gr@@ ab@@ bing a book off your sh@@ el@@ f@@ .    
 Then you can f@@ li@@ p through this book while high@@ li@@ gh@@ ting the lin@@ es, words on the virtu@@ al tou@@ ch pa@@ d bel@@ ow each flo@@ ating win@@ dow@@ .    
 Ar@@ ch@@ itec@@ ts can stre@@ t@@ ch or ro@@ t@@ ate the model@@ s with their two hands direc@@ t@@ ly.    
 So in these exam@@ pl@@ es, we are reach@@ ing into the digital world.    
 But how about re@@ vers@@ ing its ro@@ le and having the digital information re@@ ach us in@@ ste@@ ad@@ ?    
 I'm sure many of us have had the experience of bu@@ ying and re@@ tur@@ ning it@@ em@@ s on@@ lin@@ e.    
 But now you don't have to wor@@ ry about it.    
 What I got here is an online augmented f@@ it@@ ting room.    
 This is a view that you get from head@@ -@@ moun@@ ted or see@@ -@@ through disp@@ la@@ y when the system under@@ stan@@ ds the ge@@ ome@@ try of your bod@@ y.    
 T@@ a@@ king this idea f@@ ur@@ ther@@ , I started to think, instead of just seeing these pixel@@ s in our space, how can we make it physical so that we can tou@@ ch and feel it?    
 What would such a future look like@@ ?    
 At M@@ I@@ T M@@ edi@@ a L@@ ab@@ , along with my adv@@ is@@ or H@@ i@@ ro@@ sh@@ i I@@ shi@@ i and my collabor@@ at@@ or Re@@ h@@ m@@ i P@@ o@@ st, we created this one physical pixel@@ .    
 Well, in this case, this sp@@ her@@ ical mag@@ net ac@@ ts like a 3@@ D pix@@ el in our space, which means that both compu@@ ters and people can move this objec@@ t to any@@ where within this little 3@@ D spac@@ e.    
 What we did was ess@@ entially can@@ c@@ el@@ ing gra@@ v@@ ity and contro@@ l@@ ling the mov@@ ement by comb@@ ining magne@@ tic le@@ v@@ it@@ ation and mechan@@ ical actu@@ ation and sen@@ sing technologi@@ es.    
 And by dig@@ it@@ ally progr@@ am@@ m@@ ing the objec@@ t, we are li@@ ber@@ ating the objec@@ t from con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts of time and space, which means that now, human mo@@ tions can be rec@@ ord@@ ed and play@@ ed back and left per@@ man@@ ently in the physical world.    
 So cho@@ re@@ o@@ graph@@ y can be taught physic@@ ally over di@@ stan@@ ce and M@@ ic@@ ha@@ el J@@ ord@@ an@@ 's fam@@ ous sh@@ oo@@ ting can be re@@ p@@ lic@@ ated over and over as a physical real@@ ity.    
 S@@ tu@@ d@@ ents can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concep@@ ts such as plan@@ et@@ ary mo@@ tion, physic@@ s, and un@@ like computer scre@@ en@@ s or t@@ ex@@ t@@ boo@@ ks, this is a real@@ , t@@ an@@ gi@@ ble experience that you can tou@@ ch and feel@@ , and it's very power@@ ful.    
 And what's more exc@@ iting than just tur@@ ning what's cur@@ ren@@ tly in the computer physical is to start imagin@@ ing how progr@@ am@@ m@@ ing the world will al@@ ter even our da@@ ily physical ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties.    
   As you can see, the digital information will not just show us something but it will start direc@@ tly ac@@ ting up@@ on us as a part of our physical sur@@ rou@@ n@@ d@@ ings without dis@@ connec@@ ting ourselves from our world.    
 To@@ day, we started by talking about the boun@@ dar@@ y, but if we re@@ move this boun@@ dar@@ y, the only boun@@ d@@ ary left is our imagin@@ ation.    
 Thank you.    
 So I was tra@@ ined to become a g@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ast for two years in H@@ un@@ an, Chin@@ a in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s.    
 When I was in the first gra@@ de, the government wanted to trans@@ f@@ er me to a school for a@@ th@@ let@@ es, all exp@@ en@@ ses pa@@ id@@ .    
 But my ti@@ g@@ er mother said, "@@ No@@ ."    
 My parents wanted me to become an engine@@ er like them.    
 Af@@ ter survi@@ ving the C@@ ul@@ tural R@@ evolu@@ tion, they fir@@ m@@ ly believ@@ ed there's only one sure way to happin@@ ess@@ : a sa@@ fe and well@@ -@@ pa@@ id job@@ .    
 It is not important if I like the job or no@@ t.    
 But my dream was to become a Chinese oper@@ a sing@@ er.    
 That is me playing my imagin@@ ary pi@@ an@@ o.    
 A@@ n oper@@ a sing@@ er must start tra@@ ining young to learn ac@@ ro@@ ba@@ tic@@ s, so I tried everything I could to go to oper@@ a school.    
 I even wrote to the school prin@@ ci@@ p@@ al and the h@@ ost of a radi@@ o show@@ .    
 But no adul@@ ts li@@ ked the idea@@ .    
 No adul@@ ts believ@@ ed I was seri@@ ous.    
 O@@ n@@ ly my friends supp@@ or@@ ted me, but they were kid@@ s, just as power@@ less as I was@@ .    
 So at age 1@@ 5@@ , I knew I was too old to be tra@@ in@@ ed.    
 My dream would never come tru@@ e.    
 I was afraid that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ class happiness would be the best I could hope for@@ .    
 So I was de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed to find another call@@ ing.    
 No@@ body around to teach me@@ ? F@@ ine.    
 I turned to boo@@ ks.    
 I satis@@ fied my hun@@ g@@ er for paren@@ tal adv@@ ice from this book by a family of writ@@ ers and mus@@ ici@@ ans@@ .@@ [@@ "@@ C@@ or@@ respon@@ d@@ ence in the F@@ am@@ ily of F@@ ou L@@ ei@@ "@@ ] I found my ro@@ le model of an in@@ dep@@ end@@ ent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tra@@ di@@ tion re@@ qui@@ res o@@ be@@ di@@ enc@@ e@@ .@@ [@@ "@@ J@@ an@@ e E@@ y@@ re@@ "@@ ] And I learned to be eff@@ ici@@ ent from this boo@@ k@@ .@@ [@@ "@@ C@@ hea@@ per by the Do@@ zen@@ "@@ ] And I was inspi@@ red to study ab@@ road after reading thes@@ e.    
 [@@ "@@ C@@ om@@ ple@@ te Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o@@ " ] [@@ "@@ L@@ ess@@ ons F@@ rom H@@ i@@ stor@@ y@@ " by N@@ an H@@ u@@ ai@@ j@@ in@@ ] I came to the U.S. in 19@@ 9@@ 5@@ , so which books did I read here fir@@ st@@ ?    
 B@@ oo@@ ks ban@@ ned in Chin@@ a, of cour@@ se.    
 "The G@@ ood Ear@@ th@@ " is about Chinese pe@@ as@@ ant life.    
 That's just not con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent for pro@@ p@@ ag@@ an@@ da@@ . Go@@ t it.    
 The B@@ i@@ ble is interes@@ ting, but strang@@ e.    
   That's a top@@ ic for a different day.    
 "@@ You sh@@ all hon@@ or your father and mother@@ ."    
 "H@@ on@@ or@@ ," I said@@ . "@@ That's so differ@@ ent, and bet@@ ter, than o@@ be@@ y."    
 So it becomes my tool to clim@@ b out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to re@@ start my relationship with my paren@@ ts.    
 En@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a new culture also started my ha@@ bit of com@@ par@@ ative read@@ ing.    
 It offer@@ s many in@@ si@@ ght@@ s.    
 For example, I found this ma@@ p out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with@@ .    
 It had never oc@@ cur@@ red to me, Chin@@ a doesn't have to be at the cent@@ er of the world.    
 A ma@@ p actually car@@ ri@@ es some@@ bod@@ y's view@@ .    
 C@@ om@@ par@@ ative reading actually is nothing new@@ .    
 It's a stand@@ ard prac@@ tice in the a@@ ca@@ de@@ mi@@ c world.    
 There are even research fiel@@ ds such as com@@ par@@ ative reli@@ gi@@ on and com@@ par@@ ative liter@@ atu@@ re.    
 C@@ om@@ p@@ are and con@@ tr@@ ast gi@@ ves sch@@ ol@@ ars a more comple@@ te understanding of a top@@ ic.    
 So I thought, well, if com@@ par@@ ative reading wor@@ ks for rese@@ arch@@ , why not do it in da@@ ily life too@@ ?    
 So I started reading books in pa@@ ir@@ s.    
 [@@ "@@ B@@ en@@ j@@ am@@ in Fran@@ k@@ lin@@ " by W@@ al@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son@@ ]@@ [@@ "@@ Jo@@ h@@ n A@@ d@@ am@@ s@@ " by D@@ a@@ vi@@ d M@@ c@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ou@@ gh@@ ] -- who are invol@@ ved in the same ev@@ ent, or friends with sha@@ red experienc@@ es.    
 [@@ "@@ P@@ er@@ son@@ al H@@ i@@ stor@@ y@@ " by K@@ a@@ th@@ ar@@ ine G@@ ra@@ ha@@ m@@ ]@@ [@@ "The S@@ now@@ b@@ all@@ : War@@ ren Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t and the B@@ us@@ iness of Li@@ fe@@ ," by A@@ li@@ ce S@@ ch@@ ro@@ ed@@ er@@ ] I also comp@@ are the same stories in different gen@@ res -- [@@ H@@ o@@ ly B@@ i@@ b@@ le@@ : K@@ ing J@@ am@@ es V@@ er@@ sion@@ ]@@ [@@ "@@ L@@ am@@ b@@ " by Ch@@ ris@@ op@@ her M@@ oo@@ re@@ ] -- or si@@ mil@@ ar stories from different cul@@ tures, as Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h C@@ am@@ p@@ b@@ ell did in his wonder@@ ful boo@@ k@@ .@@ [@@ "The P@@ ow@@ er of M@@ y@@ th@@ " by Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h C@@ am@@ p@@ b@@ ell@@ ] For example, both the Ch@@ ri@@ st and the Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ a went through three temp@@ ta@@ tions.    
 For the Ch@@ ri@@ st, the temp@@ ta@@ tions are econom@@ ic, political and spir@@ itu@@ al.    
 For the Bu@@ dd@@ ha@@ , they are all psycho@@ log@@ ic@@ al@@ : lu@@ st, fe@@ ar and social du@@ ty -- interes@@ t@@ ing.    
 So if you know a fore@@ ign langu@@ age, it's also fu@@ n to read your favorite books in two langu@@ ag@@ es.    
 [@@ "The W@@ a@@ y of C@@ hu@@ an@@ g T@@ z@@ u@@ " Th@@ om@@ as M@@ er@@ ton@@ ]@@ [@@ "@@ T@@ a@@ o: The W@@ at@@ er@@ course W@@ ay@@ " Al@@ an W@@ att@@ s@@ ] Instea@@ d of lo@@ st in trans@@ la@@ tion, I found there is much to g@@ ain@@ .    
 For example, it's through trans@@ la@@ tion that I realized "@@ happin@@ ess@@ " in Chinese literally means "@@ fast jo@@ y." H@@ u@@ h@@ !    
 "@@ B@@ ri@@ de@@ " in Chinese literally means "@@ new mother@@ ." U@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h.    
   B@@ oo@@ ks have given me a magic p@@ ort@@ al to con@@ ne@@ ct with people of the past and the pres@@ ent.    
 I know I sh@@ all never feel l@@ on@@ ely or power@@ less again.    
 H@@ a@@ ving a dream sh@@ at@@ tered really is nothing comp@@ ared to what many other@@ s have suffer@@ ed.    
 I have come to believe that coming tru@@ e is not the only pur@@ p@@ ose of a dre@@ am.    
 I@@ ts most important pur@@ p@@ ose is to get us in tou@@ ch with where dre@@ ams come from@@ , where passion comes from@@ , where happiness comes from@@ .    
 E@@ ven a sh@@ at@@ tered dream can do that for you.    
 So because of boo@@ ks, I'm here today, happ@@ y, living again with a pur@@ p@@ ose and a cl@@ ar@@ ity, most of the time.    
 So may books be always with you.    
 Thank you.    
   Thank you. Thank you.     
 When I was in my 20@@ s, I saw my very first psycho@@ ther@@ ap@@ y cli@@ ent.    
 I was a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . stud@@ ent in cl@@ ini@@ cal psycho@@ logy at B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y.    
 She was a 2@@ 6@@ -year-old woman nam@@ ed A@@ le@@ x@@ .    
 Now A@@ le@@ x walked into her first ses@@ sion we@@ aring je@@ ans and a big s@@ l@@ ou@@ ch@@ y top@@ , and she dro@@ pped onto the cou@@ ch in my off@@ ice and k@@ ic@@ ked off her f@@ lat@@ s and told me she was there to talk about guy problem@@ s.    
 Now when I heard this, I was so reli@@ ev@@ ed.    
 My clas@@ sm@@ ate got an ar@@ son@@ ist for her first cli@@ ent.    
   And I got a twenty@@ something who wanted to talk about bo@@ y@@ s.    
 This I thought I could hand@@ le.    
 But I didn't hand@@ le it.    
 With the fun@@ ny stories that A@@ le@@ x would bring to ses@@ sion, it was easy for me just to no@@ d my head while we k@@ ic@@ ked the can down the roa@@ d.    
 "@@ Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ 's the new 20@@ ," A@@ le@@ x would say, and as far as I could tel@@ l@@ , she was right.    
 Wor@@ k happened later, mar@@ ri@@ age happened later, kids happened later, even death happened lat@@ er.    
 Tw@@ enty@@ some@@ things like A@@ le@@ x and I had nothing but time.    
 But before long@@ , my super@@ vis@@ or push@@ ed me to pus@@ h A@@ le@@ x about her love life.    
 I push@@ ed back.    
 I said, "@@ Su@@ re, she's d@@ ating dow@@ n, she's sle@@ ep@@ ing with a k@@ n@@ uck@@ le@@ hea@@ d, but it's not like she's going to mar@@ ry the gu@@ y."    
 And then my super@@ vis@@ or said, "@@ Not ye@@ t, but she might mar@@ ry the next one.    
 B@@ es@@ id@@ es, the best time to work on A@@ le@@ x@@ 's mar@@ ri@@ age is before she has one@@ ."    
 That's what psycho@@ logi@@ sts call an "A@@ ha@@ !@@ " mom@@ ent.    
 That was the moment I real@@ iz@@ ed, 30 is not the new 20@@ .    
 Y@@ es, people se@@ t@@ tle down later than they used to, but that didn't make A@@ le@@ x@@ 's 20@@ s a develop@@ mental down@@ time.    
 That made A@@ le@@ x@@ 's 20@@ s a develop@@ mental s@@ we@@ et spo@@ t, and we were sitting there, b@@ low@@ ing it.    
 That was when I realized that this sort of b@@ en@@ ign ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct was a real proble@@ m, and it had real consequ@@ enc@@ es, not just for A@@ le@@ x and her love life but for the care@@ ers and the famili@@ es and the fu@@ tures of twentysome@@ things every@@ wher@@ e.    
 There are 50 million twentysome@@ things in the United States right now.    
 We're talking about 15 percent of the popula@@ tion, or 100 percent if you consid@@ er that no one's getting through adul@@ th@@ ood without going through their 20@@ s fir@@ st.    
 R@@ a@@ ise your hand if you're in your 20@@ s.    
 I really want to see some twentysome@@ things here.    
 O@@ h, y@@ ay@@ ! You are all aw@@ es@@ om@@ e.    
 If you work with twentysome@@ things, you love a twentysome@@ thing, you're lo@@ sing sle@@ ep over twentysome@@ things, I want to see — Oka@@ y. A@@ w@@ es@@ om@@ e, twentysome@@ things really mat@@ ter.    
 So, I speci@@ al@@ ize in twentysome@@ things because I believe that every single one of those 50 million twentysome@@ things deser@@ ves to know what psycho@@ logi@@ sts, soci@@ o@@ logi@@ sts, neuro@@ logi@@ sts and fer@@ til@@ ity speci@@ al@@ ists already know@@ : that cla@@ im@@ ing your 20@@ s is one of the simp@@ l@@ es@@ t, yet most trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tive, things you can do for work, for lo@@ ve, for your happin@@ ess, maybe even for the world.    
 This is not my opini@@ on. These are the fac@@ ts.    
 We know that 8@@ 0 percent of life@@ 's most defin@@ ing moments take place by age 3@@ 5@@ .    
 That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experienc@@ es and "A@@ ha@@ !@@ " moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your m@@ id@@ -@@ 3@@ 0@@ s.    
 People who are over 4@@ 0, don't pan@@ ic.    
 This c@@ row@@ d is going to be fin@@ e, I thin@@ k.    
 We know that the first 10 years of a care@@ er has an exp@@ on@@ ential impact on how much money you're going to ear@@ n.    
 We know that more than half of Americ@@ ans are married or are living with or d@@ ating their future part@@ ner by 3@@ 0@@ .    
 We know that the brain cap@@ s off its second and last grow@@ th sp@@ ur@@ t in your 20@@ s as it re@@ wi@@ res itself for adul@@ th@@ oo@@ d, which means that what@@ ever it is you want to change about your@@ self, now is the time to change it.    
 We know that person@@ ality changes more during your 20@@ s than at any other time in life, and we know that fe@@ male fer@@ til@@ ity pe@@ a@@ ks at age 2@@ 8@@ , and things get tric@@ k@@ y after age 3@@ 5@@ . So your 20@@ s are the time to educ@@ ate your@@ self about your body and your op@@ tions.    
 So when we think about child develop@@ ment, we all know that the first five years are a cri@@ tical peri@@ od for language and att@@ ach@@ ment in the bra@@ in.    
 It's a time when your ordin@@ ar@@ y, day@@ -@@ to-@@ day life has an in@@ ordin@@ ate impact on who you will be@@ com@@ e.    
 But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as ad@@ ult develop@@ ment, and our 20@@ s are that cri@@ tical peri@@ od of ad@@ ult develop@@ ment.    
 But this isn't what twentysome@@ things are hear@@ ing.    
 N@@ ew@@ sp@@ a@@ per@@ s talk about the changing ti@@ me@@ table of adul@@ th@@ oo@@ d.    
 R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers call the 20@@ s an ex@@ t@@ ended ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ence.    
 J@@ our@@ nal@@ ists co@@ in sil@@ ly n@@ ic@@ k@@ nam@@ es for twentysome@@ things like "@@ tw@@ i@@ x@@ ter@@ s@@ " and "@@ kid@@ ul@@ t@@ s."    
  It's tru@@ e@@ !    
 As a cul@@ ture, we have tri@@ vi@@ al@@ ized what is actually the defin@@ ing deca@@ de of adul@@ th@@ oo@@ d.    
 Le@@ on@@ ard B@@ er@@ n@@ ste@@ in said that to achi@@ eve great things, you need a pl@@ an and not quite enough time.    
  I@@ s@@ n't that tru@@ e?    
 when you p@@ at a twenty@@ something on the head and you say, "@@ You have 10 ex@@ tr@@ a years to start your life@@ "@@ ?    
 No@@ thing happen@@ s.    
 You have rob@@ bed that person of his ur@@ g@@ ency and ambi@@ tion, and absolutely nothing happen@@ s.    
 And then every day, smar@@ t, interesting twentysome@@ things like you or like your s@@ ons and daugh@@ ters come into my off@@ ice and say things like this: "I know my bo@@ y@@ friend@@ 's no good for me, but this relationship doesn't coun@@ t. I'm just kill@@ ing ti@@ me@@ ."    
 Or they say, "@@ Every@@ body says as long as I get started on a care@@ er by the time I'm 3@@ 0, I'll be fin@@ e."    
 But then it starts to sound like this: "@@ My 20@@ s are almost over@@ , and I have nothing to show for my@@ self.    
 I had a better r@@ é@@ sum@@ é the day after I gradu@@ ated from colle@@ ge@@ ."    
 And then it starts to sound like this: "D@@ ating in my 20@@ s was like mus@@ ical cha@@ ir@@ s.    
 Every@@ body was run@@ ning around and having fun@@ , but then some@@ time around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting dow@@ n.    
 I didn't want to be the only one left standing up, so sometimes I think I married my h@@ us@@ b@@ and because he was the clo@@ s@@ est cha@@ ir to me at 3@@ 0@@ ."    
 Wh@@ ere are the twentysome@@ things her@@ e?    
 Do not do that.    
   Oka@@ y, now that soun@@ ds a little f@@ li@@ p, but make no mista@@ ke, the sta@@ kes are very high@@ .    
 When a lot has been push@@ ed to your 3@@ 0@@ s, there is en@@ or@@ m@@ ous th@@ ir@@ ty@@ something pres@@ sure to ju@@ mp@@ -@@ start a care@@ er, pick a c@@ ity, part@@ ner up, and have two or three kids in a much shor@@ ter peri@@ od of time.    
 M@@ any of these things are in@@ comp@@ ati@@ b@@ le, and as research is just starting to sh@@ ow, simply har@@ der and more st@@ res@@ s@@ ful to do all at once in our 3@@ 0@@ s.    
 The po@@ st@@ -@@ m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ al m@@ id@@ life cri@@ sis isn't bu@@ ying a red sp@@ or@@ ts car@@ .    
 It's real@@ izing you can't have that care@@ er you now wan@@ t.    
 It's real@@ izing you can't have that child you now wan@@ t, or you can't give your child a si@@ bl@@ ing.    
 To@@ o many th@@ ir@@ ty@@ some@@ things and for@@ ty@@ some@@ things look at them@@ selv@@ es, and at me, sitting across the room@@ , and say about their 20@@ s, "What was I do@@ ing? What was I thin@@ k@@ ing@@ ?"    
 I want to change what twentysome@@ things are doing and thin@@ king.    
 Here's a story about how that can go.    
 It's a story about a woman nam@@ ed E@@ m@@ ma@@ .    
 At 2@@ 5@@ , E@@ mm@@ a came to my off@@ ice because she was, in her words, having an identity cri@@ si@@ s.    
 She said she thought she might like to work in art or enter@@ tain@@ ment, but she ha@@ dn't decided ye@@ t, so she'd spent the last few years wa@@ iting tab@@ les instea@@ d.    
 Because it was chea@@ per@@ , she li@@ ved with a bo@@ y@@ friend who disp@@ la@@ yed his temp@@ er more than his ambi@@ tion.    
 And as hard as her 20@@ s wer@@ e, her ear@@ ly life had been even har@@ d@@ er.    
 She often cri@@ ed in our ses@@ sion@@ s, but then would colle@@ ct her@@ self by say@@ ing, "@@ You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friend@@ s."    
 Well one day, E@@ mm@@ a comes in and she han@@ g@@ s her head in her la@@ p, and she so@@ b@@ bed for most of the hour@@ .    
 S@@ he@@ 'd just b@@ ought a new ad@@ dres@@ s book, and she'd spent the mor@@ ning f@@ ill@@ ing in her many cont@@ ac@@ ts, but then she'd been left star@@ ing at that emp@@ ty bl@@ ank that comes after the words "@@ In case of emerg@@ enc@@ y, please call ..@@ ."    
 She was nearly hy@@ ster@@ ical when she looked at me and said, "@@ Wh@@ o@@ 's going to be there for me if I get in a car w@@ rec@@ k@@ ?    
 Wh@@ o@@ 's going to take care of me if I have can@@ cer@@ ?"    
 Now in that mom@@ ent, it took everything I had not to say, "I will@@ ."    
 But what E@@ mm@@ a needed wasn't some ther@@ ap@@ ist who re@@ ally, really care@@ d.    
 E@@ mm@@ a needed a better life, and I knew this was her chan@@ ce.    
 I had learned too much since I first worked with A@@ le@@ x to just s@@ it there while E@@ m@@ ma@@ 's defin@@ ing deca@@ de went par@@ ad@@ ing b@@ y.    
 So over the next weeks and month@@ s, I told E@@ mm@@ a three things that every twentysome@@ thing, male or fe@@ mal@@ e, deser@@ ves to hear@@ .    
 Fir@@ st, I told E@@ mm@@ a to for@@ get about having an identity cri@@ sis and get some identity cap@@ it@@ al.    
 By "@@ get identity cap@@ it@@ al@@ ," I mean do something that ad@@ ds value to who you are.    
 Do something that's an inv@@ est@@ ment in who you might want to be nex@@ t.    
 I didn't know the future of E@@ m@@ ma@@ 's care@@ er, and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: I@@ d@@ enti@@ ty cap@@ ital be@@ gets identity cap@@ it@@ al.    
 So now is the time for that c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ -@@ country job@@ , that inter@@ n@@ shi@@ p, that star@@ tu@@ p you want to tr@@ y.    
 I'm not dis@@ coun@@ ting twenty@@ something explor@@ ation here, but I am dis@@ coun@@ ting explor@@ ation that's not supposed to coun@@ t, whi@@ ch, by the way, is not explor@@ ation.    
 That's proc@@ ra@@ st@@ in@@ ation.    
 I told E@@ mm@@ a to explor@@ e work and make it coun@@ t.    
 S@@ econ@@ d, I told E@@ mm@@ a that the ur@@ b@@ an tri@@ be is over@@ r@@ ated.    
 B@@ est friends are great for giving ri@@ des to the air@@ por@@ t, but twentysome@@ things who hu@@ dd@@ le together with like@@ -@@ min@@ ded pe@@ ers lim@@ it who they know, what they know, how they think, how they spea@@ k, and where they work.    
 That new piece of cap@@ it@@ al, that new person to d@@ ate almost always comes from outside the inner cir@@ c@@ le.    
 New things come from what are called our wea@@ k ties, our friends of friends of friend@@ s.    
 So y@@ es, half of twentysome@@ things are un@@ - or under@@ -@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ed.    
 But half aren@@ '@@ t, and wea@@ k ties are how you get your@@ self into that grou@@ p.    
 H@@ al@@ f of new job@@ s are never po@@ st@@ ed, so reach@@ ing out to your neighbor@@ 's b@@ os@@ s is how you get that un@@ po@@ sted job@@ .    
 It's not che@@ at@@ ing. It's the science of how information sp@@ read@@ s.    
 L@@ ast but not lea@@ st, E@@ mm@@ a believ@@ ed that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friend@@ s.    
 Now this was tru@@ e for her growing up, but as a twentysome@@ thing, soon E@@ mm@@ a would pick her family when she part@@ n@@ ered with someone and created a family of her ow@@ n.    
 I told E@@ mm@@ a the time to start pic@@ king your family is now.    
 Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to se@@ t@@ tle down than 20@@ , or even 2@@ 5@@ , and I ag@@ ree with you.    
 But gr@@ ab@@ bing who@@ ever you're living with or sle@@ ep@@ ing with when everyone on F@@ ace@@ book starts walking down the a@@ is@@ le is not progres@@ s.    
 The best time to work on your mar@@ ri@@ age is before you have one, and that means being as in@@ ten@@ tional with love as you are with work.    
 P@@ ic@@ king your family is about conscious@@ ly choos@@ ing who and what you want rather than just making it work or kill@@ ing time with who@@ ever happens to be choos@@ ing you.    
 So what happened to E@@ m@@ ma@@ ?    
 Well, we went through that ad@@ dres@@ s book, and she found an old room@@ mat@@ e's cou@@ s@@ in who worked at an art mus@@ e@@ um in another st@@ ate.    
 That wea@@ k ti@@ e helped her get a job there.    
 That job offer gave her the reason to leave that liv@@ e-@@ in bo@@ y@@ fri@@ en@@ d.    
 Now, five years later, she's a speci@@ al ev@@ ents plan@@ ner for mus@@ e@@ um@@ s.    
 S@@ he's married to a man she mind@@ fully ch@@ os@@ e.    
 She lo@@ ves her new care@@ er, she lo@@ ves her new family, and she sent me a c@@ ard that said, "@@ Now the emerg@@ ency cont@@ act b@@ lan@@ ks don't seem big enou@@ gh@@ ."    
 Now E@@ m@@ ma@@ 's story made that sound eas@@ y, but that's what I love about working with twentysome@@ things.    
 They are so easy to hel@@ p.    
 Tw@@ enty@@ some@@ things are like air@@ plan@@ es just lea@@ ving L@@ A@@ X@@ , b@@ ound for some@@ where w@@ es@@ t. Ri@@ ght after ta@@ ke@@ off@@ , a s@@ light change in course is the difference between lan@@ ding in Al@@ as@@ k@@ a or F@@ i@@ j@@ i@@ .    
 Li@@ ke@@ wis@@ e, at 2@@ 1 or 2@@ 5 or even 2@@ 9@@ , one good conversa@@ tion, one good brea@@ k, one good TED T@@ al@@ k, can have an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous effec@@ t across years and even gener@@ ations to com@@ e.    
 So here's an idea worth sp@@ reading to every twenty@@ something you know.    
 It's as simple as what I learned to say to A@@ le@@ x@@ .    
 It's what I now have the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of sa@@ ying to twentysome@@ things like E@@ mm@@ a every single day@@ : Th@@ ir@@ ty is not the new 20@@ , so cla@@ i@@ m your adul@@ th@@ oo@@ d, get some identity cap@@ it@@ al, use your wea@@ k ties, pick your famil@@ y.    
 D@@ on@@ 't be defin@@ ed by what you didn't know or didn't do.    
 You're dec@@ id@@ ing your life right now.    
 Thank you.    
 When I was 2@@ 7 years old, I left a very de@@ man@@ ding job in man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment con@@ sul@@ ting for a job that was even more de@@ man@@ d@@ ing@@ : teach@@ ing.    
 I went to teach se@@ v@@ ent@@ h gra@@ d@@ ers mat@@ h in the New York C@@ ity public school@@ s.    
 And like any teach@@ er, I made qu@@ iz@@ z@@ es and tes@@ ts.    
 I gave out home@@ work assig@@ n@@ ment@@ s.    
 When the work came back, I cal@@ cul@@ ated gra@@ d@@ es.    
 What struc@@ k me was that I@@ Q was not the only difference between my best and my worst stud@@ ents.    
 Some of my str@@ ong@@ est perfor@@ m@@ ers did not have str@@ at@@ os@@ ph@@ er@@ ic I@@ Q s@@ co@@ re@@ s.    
 Some of my smar@@ test kids weren't doing so well.    
 And that got me thin@@ king.    
 The kinds of things you need to learn in se@@ v@@ ent@@ h gra@@ de ma@@ th, su@@ re, they're har@@ d@@ : ra@@ ti@@ o@@ s, deci@@ mal@@ s, the area of a par@@ all@@ el@@ o@@ gr@@ am.    
 But these concep@@ ts are not impos@@ sib@@ le, and I was fir@@ m@@ ly con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that every one of my students could learn the materi@@ al if they worked hard and long enou@@ gh@@ .    
 Af@@ ter several more years of teach@@ ing, I came to the con@@ cl@@ usi@@ on that what we need in edu@@ cation is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motiv@@ a@@ tional perspec@@ tive, from a psycho@@ logical perspec@@ tive.    
 In edu@@ cation, the one thing we know how to measure best is I@@ Q@@ .    
 But what if doing well in school and in life than your ability to learn quick@@ ly and eas@@ il@@ y?    
 So I left the clas@@ s@@ room@@ , and I went to gradu@@ ate school to become a psycho@@ logi@@ st.    
 I started stud@@ ying kids and adul@@ ts in all kinds of su@@ per challeng@@ ing se@@ tt@@ ings, and in every study my question was, who is success@@ ful here and wh@@ y?    
 My research team and I went to W@@ est P@@ o@@ in@@ t M@@ il@@ it@@ ary A@@ ca@@ de@@ m@@ y.    
 We tried to pre@@ di@@ ct which ca@@ de@@ ts would sta@@ y in mil@@ it@@ ary tra@@ ining and which would dro@@ p out.    
 We went to the Na@@ tional S@@ p@@ ell@@ ing Be@@ e and tried to pre@@ di@@ ct which children would adv@@ ance far@@ th@@ est in compe@@ ti@@ tion.    
 We stu@@ died roo@@ ki@@ e teach@@ ers working in really tou@@ gh neighbor@@ h@@ oo@@ ds, asking which teach@@ ers are still going to be here in teach@@ ing by the end of the school year, and of th@@ os@@ e, who will be the most effec@@ tive at impro@@ ving learning out@@ comes for their stud@@ ent@@ s?    
 We part@@ n@@ ered with pri@@ v@@ ate comp@@ ani@@ es, as@@ king, which of these sal@@ es@@ people is going to keep their job@@ s?    
 And who's going to ear@@ n the most mone@@ y?    
 In all those very different cont@@ ex@@ ts, one charac@@ ter@@ istic emerg@@ ed as a signific@@ ant pre@@ dic@@ tor of succ@@ ess.    
 And it wasn't social intellig@@ ence.    
 It wasn't good loo@@ ks, physical heal@@ th, and it wasn't I@@ Q@@ .    
 It was gr@@ it.    
 G@@ rit is passion and per@@ sever@@ ance for very long@@ -@@ term go@@ als.    
 G@@ rit is having st@@ am@@ in@@ a.    
 G@@ rit is s@@ tic@@ king with your fu@@ ture, day in, day out, not just for the wee@@ k, not just for the mon@@ th, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a real@@ ity.    
 G@@ rit is living life like it's a mar@@ a@@ th@@ on, not a sp@@ rin@@ t.    
 A few years ago, I started stud@@ ying g@@ rit in the C@@ hi@@ ca@@ go public school@@ s.    
 I asked thousands of high school j@@ uni@@ ors to take g@@ rit ques@@ tion@@ na@@ i@@ re@@ s, and then wa@@ ited around more than a year to see who would gradu@@ ate.    
 T@@ ur@@ ns out that gr@@ it@@ ti@@ er kids were signific@@ an@@ tly more likely to gradu@@ at@@ e, even when I mat@@ ched them on every charac@@ ter@@ istic I could meas@@ u@@ re, things like family in@@ com@@ e, stan@@ dar@@ di@@ zed achiev@@ ement test s@@ co@@ re@@ s, even how sa@@ fe kids felt when they were at school.    
 So it's not just at W@@ est P@@ o@@ in@@ t or the Na@@ tional S@@ p@@ ell@@ ing Be@@ e that g@@ rit mat@@ ters.    
 It's also in school, especially for kids at ris@@ k for dro@@ pp@@ ing out.    
 To me, the most sh@@ oc@@ king thing about g@@ rit is how little we know, how little science know@@ s, about building it.    
 Every day, parents and teach@@ ers ask me, "@@ How do I build g@@ rit in kid@@ s?    
 What do I do to teach kids a so@@ li@@ d work eth@@ ic@@ ?    
 How do I keep them motiv@@ ated for the long run@@ ?"    
 The hon@@ est answer is, I don't know. What I do know is that tal@@ ent doesn't make you gr@@ it@@ ty.    
 Our data show very c@@ lear@@ ly that there are many tal@@ ent@@ ed individu@@ als who simply do not follow through on their comm@@ it@@ ment@@ s.    
 In fact, in our dat@@ a, g@@ rit is usually un@@ rel@@ ated or even in@@ ver@@ sel@@ y rel@@ ated to meas@@ u@@ res of tal@@ ent.    
 So far@@ , the best idea I've heard about building g@@ rit in kids is something called "@@ grow@@ th mind@@ se@@ t@@ ."    
 This is an idea develop@@ ed at St@@ an@@ for@@ d U@@ ni@@ versity by C@@ ar@@ o@@ l D@@ we@@ c@@ k, and it is the beli@@ ef that the ability to learn is not fi@@ x@@ ed, that it can change with your eff@@ or@@ t.    
 D@@ r. D@@ we@@ ck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow@@ s in respon@@ se to challeng@@ e, they're much more likely to per@@ sever@@ e when they fa@@ il, because they don't believe that fail@@ ure is a per@@ man@@ ent condi@@ tion.    
 So grow@@ th mind@@ set is a great idea for building gr@@ it.    
 But we need more.    
 And that's where I'm going to end my re@@ mar@@ ks, because that's where we are.    
 That's the work that stan@@ ds before us.    
 We need to take our best ide@@ as, our str@@ ong@@ est intui@@ tions, and we need to test them.    
 We need to measure whether we've been success@@ ful, and we have to be willing to fa@@ il, to be wr@@ ong, to start over again with less@@ ons lear@@ ne@@ d.    
 In other words, we need to be gr@@ it@@ ty about getting our kids gr@@ it@@ ti@@ er.    
 Thank you.    
 G@@ row@@ ing up in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an as the daughter of a cal@@ li@@ graph@@ er, one of my most tre@@ as@@ u@@ red memor@@ ies was my mother showing me the beau@@ ty, the shape and the form of Chinese charac@@ ters.    
 E@@ ver since then, I was fascin@@ ated by this incredi@@ ble langu@@ age.    
 But to an out@@ sid@@ er, it seems to be as imp@@ ene@@ tr@@ able as the Gre@@ at W@@ all of Chin@@ a.    
 O@@ ver the past few years, I've been wonder@@ ing if I can break down this w@@ all, so anyone who wan@@ ts to understand and app@@ reci@@ ate the beau@@ ty of this s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated language could do so@@ .    
 I started thinking about how a new@@ , fast me@@ th@@ od of learning Chinese might be us@@ e@@ ful.    
 S@@ in@@ ce the age of fi@@ ve, I started to learn how to dra@@ w every single st@@ ro@@ ke for each charac@@ ter in the cor@@ rec@@ t sequ@@ ence.    
 I learned new charac@@ ters every day S@@ in@@ ce we only have five minut@@ es, it's better that we have a fast and simp@@ l@@ er way.    
 A Chinese sch@@ ol@@ ar would understand 20@@ ,000 charac@@ ters.    
 You only need 1@@ ,000 to understand the basic liter@@ ac@@ y.    
 The top 2@@ 00 will allow you to comp@@ re@@ h@@ end 40 percent of basic liter@@ atu@@ re -- enough to read road sig@@ n@@ s, re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant men@@ us, to understand the basic idea of the we@@ b p@@ ages or the new@@ sp@@ a@@ per@@ s.    
 To@@ day I'm going to start with eight to show you how the me@@ th@@ od work@@ s.    
 You are read@@ y?    
 O@@ p@@ en your m@@ outh as w@@ ide as possible until it's squ@@ are.    
 You get a m@@ ou@@ th.    
 This is a person going for a wal@@ k.    
 P@@ er@@ s@@ on.    
 If the shape of the fire is a person with two ar@@ ms on both sid@@ es, as if she was y@@ ell@@ ing f@@ ran@@ tic@@ ally, "H@@ el@@ p@@ ! I'm on fi@@ re@@ !@@ " -- This sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l actually is or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally from the shape of the fl@@ am@@ e, but I like to think that way. Wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever wor@@ ks for you.    
 This is a tre@@ e.    
 T@@ re@@ e.    
 This is a moun@@ tain@@ .    
 The sun@@ .    
 The mo@@ on.    
 The sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the door looks like a pa@@ ir of sal@@ o@@ on do@@ ors in the w@@ il@@ d w@@ es@@ t.    
 I call these eight charac@@ ters ra@@ dic@@ als.    
 They are the building bloc@@ ks for you to create lots more charac@@ ters.    
 A pers@@ on.    
 If someone wal@@ ks beh@@ in@@ d, that is "@@ to follow@@ ."    
 As the old sa@@ ying go@@ es, two is compan@@ y, three is a c@@ row@@ d.    
 If a person stre@@ t@@ ched their ar@@ ms w@@ id@@ e, this person is say@@ ing, "@@ It was this bi@@ g@@ ."    
 The person inside the m@@ ou@@ th, the person is tra@@ p@@ pe@@ d.    
 H@@ e's a pri@@ son@@ er, just like J@@ on@@ a@@ h inside the wh@@ al@@ e.    
 One t@@ ree is a tre@@ e. Tw@@ o tre@@ es together, we have the w@@ oo@@ ds.    
 Th@@ ree tre@@ es together, we create the fore@@ st.    
 P@@ ut a pl@@ ank under@@ ne@@ ath the tre@@ e, we have the foun@@ da@@ tion.    
 P@@ ut a m@@ outh on the top of the tre@@ e, that's "@@ i@@ di@@ o@@ t@@ ." E@@ as@@ y to rememb@@ er, since a talking t@@ ree is pretty i@@ di@@ o@@ tic.    
 Re@@ memb@@ er fi@@ re@@ ?    
 Tw@@ o fi@@ res together, I get really ho@@ t.    
 Th@@ ree fi@@ res together, that's a lot of fl@@ am@@ es.    
 S@@ et the fire under@@ ne@@ ath the two tre@@ es, it's bur@@ n@@ ing.    
 For us, the su@@ n is the sour@@ ce of pro@@ s@@ per@@ ity.    
 Tw@@ o sun@@ s together, pro@@ s@@ per@@ ous.    
 Th@@ ree together, that's sp@@ ar@@ k@@ les.    
 P@@ ut the su@@ n and the mo@@ on sh@@ ining together, it's bri@@ ght@@ n@@ ess.    
 It also means tom@@ or@@ row@@ , after a day and a ni@@ ght.    
 The su@@ n is coming up abo@@ ve the hor@@ iz@@ on. S@@ un@@ ri@@ se.    
 A do@@ or. P@@ ut a pl@@ ank inside the do@@ or, it's a door b@@ ol@@ t.    
 P@@ ut a m@@ outh inside the do@@ or, asking ques@@ tions.    
 K@@ no@@ ck kno@@ c@@ k. Is anyone home@@ ?    
 This person is s@@ ne@@ a@@ king out of a do@@ or, es@@ cap@@ ing, ev@@ ad@@ ing.    
 On the lef@@ t, we have a wom@@ an.    
 Tw@@ o women together, they have an argu@@ ment.    
   Th@@ ree women together, be care@@ ful, it's adul@@ ter@@ y.    
 So we have gone through almost 30 charac@@ ters.    
 By using this me@@ tho@@ d, the first eight ra@@ dic@@ als will allow you to build 3@@ 2@@ .    
 The next group of eight charac@@ ters will build an ex@@ tr@@ a 3@@ 2@@ .    
 So with very little eff@@ or@@ t, you will be able to learn a couple hundred charac@@ ters, which is the same as a Chinese ei@@ ght@@ -year-@@ ol@@ d.    
 So after we know the charac@@ ters, we start building ph@@ r@@ as@@ es.    
 For example, the moun@@ tain and the fire together, we have fire moun@@ tain@@ . It's a vol@@ can@@ o.    
 We know J@@ ap@@ an is the land of the ri@@ sing sun@@ .    
 This is a su@@ n plac@@ ed with the or@@ ig@@ in, because J@@ ap@@ an li@@ es to the e@@ ast of Chin@@ a.    
 So a sun@@ , or@@ ig@@ in together, we build J@@ ap@@ an.    
 A person behind J@@ ap@@ an, what do we ge@@ t?    
 A J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese pers@@ on.    
 The charac@@ ter on the left is two moun@@ tain@@ s st@@ ac@@ ked on top of each other.    
 In ancient Chin@@ a, that means in ex@@ i@@ le, because Chinese em@@ per@@ or@@ s, they put their political en@@ em@@ ies in ex@@ i@@ le beyond moun@@ tain@@ s.    
 No@@ wa@@ days, ex@@ i@@ le has turned into getting out.    
 A m@@ outh which tel@@ ls you where to get out is an ex@@ it.    
 This is a sli@@ de to re@@ mind me that I should stop talking and get off of the st@@ age. Thank you.    
 You know, my favorite part of being a da@@ d is the movi@@ es I get to wat@@ ch.    
 I love sh@@ aring my favorite movi@@ es with my kid@@ s, and when my daughter was four@@ , we got to watch "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ " together.    
 It totally dom@@ in@@ ated her imagin@@ ation for month@@ s.    
 H@@ er favorite charac@@ ter was G@@ lin@@ da@@ , of cour@@ se.    
 It gave her a great exc@@ use to wear a sp@@ ar@@ k@@ ly dres@@ s and car@@ ry a wan@@ d.    
 But you watch that movie enough times, and you start to realize how un@@ usu@@ al it is.    
 Now we live today, and are rais@@ ing our children, in a kind of children@@ '@@ s@@ -@@ f@@ ant@@ as@@ y@@ -@@ spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar@@ -@@ indu@@ stri@@ al comple@@ x@@ .    
 But "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ " st@@ ood al@@ one.    
 It did not start that t@@ ren@@ d.    
 F@@ or@@ ty years later was when the tre@@ nd really caught on, with@@ , interes@@ t@@ ing@@ ly, another movie that fe@@ atu@@ red a me@@ tal guy and a f@@ ur@@ ry guy res@@ cu@@ ing a girl by dres@@ sing up as the en@@ em@@ y's gu@@ ar@@ ds.    
 Do you know what I'm talking ab@@ out@@ ? Yea@@ h.    
 Now, there's a big difference between these two movi@@ es, a couple of really big differ@@ ences between "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ " and all the movi@@ es we watch today.    
 One is there's very little violence in "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ ."    
 The mon@@ ke@@ ys are rather ag@@ gres@@ si@@ ve, as are the app@@ le tre@@ es.    
 But I think if "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ " were made today, the w@@ iz@@ ard would say, "D@@ or@@ o@@ th@@ y, you are the sa@@ vi@@ or of O@@ z that the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y fore@@ t@@ ol@@ d.    
 U@@ se your magic sli@@ p@@ per@@ s to de@@ fe@@ at the compu@@ ter@@ -@@ gener@@ ated ar@@ mi@@ es of the W@@ ic@@ ked W@@ it@@ ch@@ ."    
 But that's not how it happen@@ s.    
 A@@ no@@ ther thing that's really unique about "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ " to me is that all of the most her@@ o@@ ic and w@@ ise and even v@@ il@@ la@@ in@@ ous charac@@ ters are fe@@ mal@@ e.    
 Now I started to no@@ tice this when I actually show@@ ed "@@ S@@ ta@@ r War@@ s@@ " to my daugh@@ ter, which was years later, and the situation was differ@@ ent.    
 At that point I also had a s@@ on.    
 He was only three at the time.    
 He was not inv@@ ited to the scre@@ en@@ ing. He was too young for that.    
 But he was the second chil@@ d, and the level of super@@ vi@@ sion had pl@@ um@@ me@@ ted. So he wan@@ der@@ ed in, and it imp@@ rin@@ ted on him like a mom@@ my duc@@ k does to its duc@@ k@@ l@@ ing, and I don't think he under@@ stan@@ ds what's going on, but he is sure so@@ a@@ king in it.    
 And I won@@ der what he's so@@ a@@ king in.    
 Is he pic@@ king up on the them@@ es of courage and per@@ sever@@ ance and lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty@@ ?    
 Is he pic@@ king up on the fact that L@@ u@@ ke jo@@ ins an ar@@ my to over@@ th@@ row the govern@@ ment@@ ?    
 Is he pic@@ king up on the fact that there are only bo@@ ys in the univer@@ se excep@@ t for A@@ un@@ t B@@ er@@ u@@ , and of course this prin@@ c@@ ess, who's really co@@ ol@@ , but who kind of wa@@ its around through most of the movie so that she can aw@@ ard the her@@ o with a me@@ d@@ al and a win@@ k to th@@ ank him for sa@@ ving the univer@@ se, which he does by the magic that he was born with@@ ?    
 C@@ om@@ p@@ are this to 19@@ 3@@ 9 with "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ ."    
 How does D@@ or@@ o@@ th@@ y win her movi@@ e?    
 By making friends with everybody and being a lead@@ er.    
 That's kind of the world I'd rather ra@@ ise my kids in -- O@@ z@@ , right? -- and not the world of du@@ des fi@@ ght@@ ing, which is where we kind of have to be.    
 in the movi@@ es we have for our kid@@ s, and so little y@@ el@@ low bri@@ ck ro@@ ad@@ ?    
 There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the bo@@ y@@ -@@ viol@@ ent movie has on girl@@ s, and you should do that read@@ ing. It's very goo@@ d.    
 I haven't read as much on how bo@@ ys are pic@@ king up on this vi@@ be.    
 I know from my own experience that P@@ rin@@ c@@ ess L@@ ei@@ a did not provid@@ e the a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate cont@@ ext that I could have used in na@@ vi@@ g@@ ating the ad@@ ult world that is co@@ -@@ ed. I think there was a fir@@ st@@ -@@ k@@ is@@ s moment when I really expec@@ ted the cre@@ d@@ its to start ro@@ l@@ ling because that's the end of the movi@@ e, right?    
 I fin@@ ish@@ ed my ques@@ t, I got the girl@@ .    
 Why are you still standing ther@@ e?    
 I don't know what I'm supposed to do.    
 The movi@@ es are very, very foc@@ used on de@@ fe@@ ating the v@@ il@@ la@@ in and getting your re@@ war@@ d, and there's not a lot of room for other relationshi@@ ps and other jour@@ ne@@ y@@ s.    
 It's almost as though if you're a bo@@ y, you are a d@@ op@@ ey anim@@ al, and if you are a girl@@ , you should bring your war@@ ri@@ or co@@ stu@@ me.    
 There are pl@@ ent@@ y of excep@@ tions, and I will def@@ end the D@@ is@@ ney prin@@ c@@ ess@@ es in front of any you.    
 But they do s@@ end a messa@@ ge to bo@@ ys, that they are not, the bo@@ ys are not really the target audi@@ ence.    
 They are doing a ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al job of teach@@ ing girls how to def@@ end against the pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ y, but they are not necess@@ arily showing bo@@ ys how they're supposed to def@@ end against the pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ y.    
 There's no model@@ s for them.    
 And we also have some terri@@ fic women who are writing new stories for our kid@@ s, and as th@@ ree@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ sion@@ al and deli@@ ght@@ ful as H@@ er@@ mi@@ one and K@@ at@@ n@@ is@@ s are, these are still wa@@ r movi@@ es. And, of course, the most success@@ ful stu@@ di@@ o of all time contin@@ u@@ es to c@@ ran@@ k out clas@@ si@@ c after clas@@ sic@@ , every single one of them about the jour@@ ney of a bo@@ y, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his s@@ on,    
 or two men who are rais@@ ing a little girl@@ .    
 Un@@ til@@ , as many of you are thinking, this year, when they finally came out with "@@ B@@ ra@@ ve@@ ."    
 I re@@ comm@@ end it to all of you. It's on de@@ m@@ and now.    
 Do you remember what the cri@@ tics said when "@@ B@@ ra@@ ve@@ " came out@@ ?    
 "A@@ w@@ , I can't believe P@@ i@@ x@@ ar made a prin@@ c@@ ess movi@@ e."    
 It's very goo@@ d. D@@ on@@ 't let that stop you.    
 Now, almost n@@ one of these movi@@ es pas@@ s the Be@@ ch@@ del T@@ es@@ t.    
 I don't know if you've heard of this.    
 It has not yet caught on and caught fi@@ re, but maybe today we will start a mov@@ em@@ ent.    
 A@@ li@@ son Be@@ ch@@ del is a com@@ ic book arti@@ st, and back in the m@@ id@@ -@@ '@@ 80@@ s, she rec@@ ord@@ ed this conversation she'd had with a friend about as@@ s@@ ess@@ ing the movi@@ es that they sa@@ w@@ .    
 And it's very simp@@ le. There's just three questions you should as@@ k@@ : Is there more than one charac@@ ter in the movie that is fe@@ male who has lin@@ es?    
 So try to meet that bar@@ .    
 And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movi@@ e?    
 And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like@@ ? Ri@@ ght? Thank you. Thank you very much.    
 Tw@@ o women who ex@@ ist and talk to each other about stuff@@ .    
 It does happen@@ . I've seen it, and yet I very ra@@ rely see it in the movi@@ es that we know and lo@@ ve.    
 In fact, this week I went to see a very high@@ -@@ qu@@ ality movi@@ e, "@@ Ar@@ go@@ ."    
 Ri@@ ght? O@@ s@@ car bu@@ z@@ z@@ , doing great at the bo@@ x offic@@ e, a con@@ sen@@ su@@ s idea of what a qu@@ ality Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood film is.    
 It pretty much fl@@ un@@ ks the Be@@ ch@@ del tes@@ t.    
 And I don't think it sh@@ oul@@ d, because a lot of the movi@@ e, I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie takes place in this em@@ bas@@ s@@ y where men and women are h@@ id@@ ing out during the ho@@ st@@ age cri@@ si@@ s.    
 We've got quite a few scen@@ es of the men having deep@@ , ang@@ st@@ -@@ ri@@ dd@@ en conversa@@ tions in this h@@ ide@@ out, and the great moment for one of the ac@@ t@@ res@@ ses is to pe@@ e@@ k through the door and say, "A@@ re you coming to be@@ d, hon@@ ey@@ ?"    
 That's Hol@@ ly@@ w@@ ood for you.    
 So let's look at the numb@@ ers.    
 20@@ 1@@ 1, of the 100 most pop@@ ular movi@@ es, how many of them do you think actually have fe@@ male pro@@ ta@@ g@@ on@@ ist@@ s?    
 E@@ le@@ ven@@ . It's not ba@@ d.    
 It's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elec@@ ted to C@@ ong@@ res@@ s, so that's goo@@ d.    
 But there is a number that is great@@ er than this that's going to bring this room dow@@ n.    
 L@@ ast year, The New York T@@ im@@ es publi@@ sh@@ ed a study that the government had don@@ e.    
 One out of five women in Americ@@ a say that they have been sex@@ u@@ ally as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted some time in their life.    
 Now, I don't think that's the fa@@ ult of pop@@ ular enter@@ tain@@ ment.    
 I don't think kid@@ s' movi@@ es have anything to do with that.    
 music vide@@ os or por@@ no@@ graph@@ y are really direc@@ tly rel@@ ated to that, but something is going wr@@ ong, and when I hear that sta@@ tis@@ tic@@ , one of the things I think of is that's a lot of sex@@ u@@ al as@@ sa@@ il@@ an@@ ts.    
 Who are these gu@@ y@@ s? What are they lear@@ n@@ ing?    
 What are they fail@@ ing to lear@@ n@@ ?    
 Are they ab@@ sor@@ bing the story that a male her@@ o@@ 's job is to de@@ fe@@ at the v@@ il@@ la@@ in with violence and then colle@@ ct the re@@ war@@ d, which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't spea@@ k@@ ?    
 Are we so@@ a@@ king up that stor@@ y?    
 You know, as a paren@@ t with the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge of rais@@ ing a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this sta@@ ti@@ sti@@ c very al@@ ar@@ m@@ ing and we want to pre@@ p@@ are them.    
 We have tools at our disp@@ os@@ al like "@@ girl power@@ ," and we hope that that will hel@@ p, but I go@@ tt@@ a won@@ d@@ er, is girl power going to prote@@ ct them i@@ f@@ , at the same time, ac@@ tively or pas@@ si@@ vel@@ y, we are tra@@ ining our s@@ ons to main@@ tain their boy power@@ ?    
 I mean, I think the N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x qu@@ e@@ ue is one way that we can do something very import@@ ant, and I'm talking main@@ ly to the da@@ ds here.    
 I think we have got to show our s@@ ons a new defin@@ i@@ tion of man@@ h@@ oo@@ d.    
 The defin@@ i@@ tion of man@@ hood is already tur@@ ning up@@ side dow@@ n.    
 You@@ 've read about how the new econom@@ y is changing the ro@@ les of care@@ gi@@ ver and wa@@ ge ear@@ n@@ er.    
 They're th@@ row@@ ing it up in the air@@ .    
 So our s@@ ons are going to have to find some way of adap@@ ting to this, some new relationship with each other@@ , and I think we really have to show them, and model for them, how a real man is someone who tru@@ sts his sist@@ ers and res@@ pec@@ ts them, and wan@@ ts to be on their te@@ am, and stan@@ ds up against the real bad gu@@ ys, who are the men who want to ab@@ use the wom@@ en.    
 And I think our job in the N@@ et@@ f@@ li@@ x qu@@ e@@ ue is to look out for those movi@@ es that pas@@ s the Be@@ ch@@ del T@@ es@@ t, if we can find them, and to see@@ k out the her@@ o@@ ines who are there, who show real coura@@ g@@ e, who bring people together, and to nu@@ dge our s@@ ons to identi@@ fy with those her@@ o@@ ines and to say, "I want to be on their te@@ am@@ ," because they're going to be on their te@@ am.    
 When I asked my daughter who her favorite charac@@ ter was in "@@ S@@ ta@@ r War@@ s@@ ," do you know what she said@@ ?    
 O@@ bi@@ -@@ W@@ an.    
 O@@ bi@@ -@@ W@@ an Ken@@ ob@@ i and G@@ lin@@ da@@ .    
 What do these two have in com@@ mon@@ ?    
 Maybe it's not just the sp@@ ar@@ k@@ ly dres@@ s.    
 I think these people are exper@@ ts.    
 I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody el@@ se, and they love sh@@ aring their knowledge with other people to help them re@@ ach their pot@@ enti@@ al.    
 Now, they are lead@@ ers.    
 I like that kind of qu@@ est for my daugh@@ ter, and I like that kind of qu@@ est for my s@@ on.    
 I want more ques@@ ts like that.    
 I want fe@@ w@@ er ques@@ ts where my son is t@@ old, "@@ G@@ o out and fi@@ ght it al@@ one@@ ," and more ques@@ ts where he se@@ es that it's his job to jo@@ in a te@@ am, maybe a team led by wom@@ en, to help other people become better and be better people, like the W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ .    
 Thank you.    
 When I was a child growing up in M@@ ain@@ e, one of my favorite things to do was to look for s@@ and dollars on the se@@ ash@@ ore@@ s of M@@ ain@@ e, because my parents told me it would bring me l@@ uc@@ k.    
 But you know, these sh@@ ell@@ s, they're hard to fin@@ d.    
 They're cover@@ ed in s@@ and, they're difficult to se@@ e.    
 H@@ o@@ we@@ ver, over time, I got used to looking for them.    
 I started seeing sha@@ p@@ es and patter@@ ns that helped me to colle@@ ct them.    
 This grew into a passion for fin@@ ding things, a love for the past and ar@@ cha@@ e@@ o@@ log@@ y.    
 And even@@ tu@@ ally, when I started stud@@ ying Egyp@@ to@@ log@@ y, I realized that seeing with my na@@ ked ey@@ es alone wasn't enou@@ gh@@ .    
 Because all of the sudd@@ en, in Egyp@@ t, my be@@ ach had grow@@ n from a tiny be@@ ach in Ma@@ ine to one eight hundred miles long@@ , next to the N@@ i@@ le.    
 And my s@@ and dollars had grow@@ n to the si@@ ze of ci@@ ties.    
 This is really what brought me to using s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite imag@@ er@@ y.    
 For trying to ma@@ p the pa@@ st, I knew that I had to see differ@@ ent@@ ly.    
 So I want to show you an example of how we see differ@@ ently using the in@@ fra@@ re@@ d.    
 This is a s@@ ite loc@@ ated in the ea@@ ster@@ n Egyp@@ ti@@ an del@@ t@@ a called M@@ end@@ es.    
 And the s@@ ite vi@@ sib@@ ly appe@@ ars b@@ row@@ n, but when we use the in@@ fra@@ red and we process it, all of the sudd@@ en, using f@@ al@@ se col@@ or, the s@@ ite appe@@ ars as b@@ right p@@ in@@ k.    
 What you are seeing are the actu@@ al chemical changes to the lan@@ ds@@ cap@@ e ca@@ used by the building materi@@ als and ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties of the ancient Egyp@@ ti@@ an@@ s.    
 What I want to share with you today is how we've used s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite data to find an ancient Egyp@@ ti@@ an c@@ ity, called I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y, mis@@ sing for thousands of years.    
 I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was ancient Egyp@@ t's cap@@ ital at a peri@@ od of time called the M@@ iddle K@@ ing@@ dom@@ , about four thous@@ and years ago.    
 The s@@ ite is loc@@ ated in the F@@ ai@@ y@@ um of Egyp@@ t, and the s@@ ite is really import@@ ant, because in the M@@ iddle K@@ ing@@ dom there was this great ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance for ancient Egyp@@ ti@@ an ar@@ t, architec@@ ture and reli@@ gi@@ on.    
 Egyp@@ to@@ logi@@ sts have always known the s@@ ite of I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was loc@@ ated some@@ where near the p@@ y@@ r@@ am@@ id@@ s of the two k@@ ings who built it, indi@@ c@@ ated within the red cir@@ cl@@ es here, but some@@ where within this mas@@ sive f@@ loo@@ d pla@@ in.    
 This area is huge -- it's four miles by three miles in si@@ z@@ e.    
 The N@@ i@@ le used to f@@ low right next to the city of I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y, and as it shi@@ f@@ ted and changed and moved over time to the ea@@ st, it cover@@ ed over the city.    
 So, how do you find a bu@@ ried city in a v@@ ast lan@@ ds@@ ca@@ pe@@ ?    
 F@@ in@@ ding it ran@@ dom@@ ly would be the e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of loc@@ ating a need@@ le in a ha@@ y@@ st@@ ac@@ k, bl@@ in@@ d@@ fol@@ ded, we@@ aring bas@@ eb@@ all m@@ it@@ ts.    
 So what we did is we used N@@ A@@ S@@ A top@@ o@@ graph@@ y data to ma@@ p out the lan@@ ds@@ cap@@ e, very sub@@ tle chang@@ es.    
 We started to be able to see where the N@@ i@@ le used to flow@@ .    
 But you can see in more deta@@ il, and even more interes@@ ting, this very s@@ light rais@@ ed area seen within the cir@@ cle up here which we thought could possib@@ ly be the lo@@ cation of the city of I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y.    
 So we collabor@@ ated with Egyp@@ ti@@ an scientists to do cor@@ ing work, which you see here.    
 When I say cor@@ ing, it's like ice cor@@ ing, but instead of lay@@ ers of climate chang@@ e, you're looking for lay@@ ers of human oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tion.    
 And, five me@@ ters dow@@ n, under@@ ne@@ ath a th@@ ic@@ k lay@@ er of mu@@ d, we found a den@@ se lay@@ er of pot@@ ter@@ y.    
 What this show@@ s is that at this possible lo@@ cation of I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y, five me@@ ters dow@@ n, we have a lay@@ er of oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tion for several hundred years, d@@ ating to the M@@ iddle K@@ ing@@ dom@@ , d@@ ating to the ex@@ act peri@@ od of time we think I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y is.    
 We also found work st@@ one -- car@@ ne@@ li@@ an, quar@@ t@@ z and ag@@ ate that show@@ s that there was a je@@ w@@ el@@ er@@ 's work@@ sho@@ p here.    
 These might not look like mu@@ ch, but when you think about the most comm@@ on st@@ ones used in je@@ w@@ el@@ ry from the M@@ iddle K@@ ing@@ dom@@ , these are the st@@ ones that were us@@ ed.    
 So, we have a den@@ se lay@@ er of oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tion d@@ ating to the M@@ iddle K@@ ing@@ dom at this sit@@ e.    
 showing that what@@ ever was there was a very important city.    
 No I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was here ye@@ t, but we're going to be re@@ tur@@ ning to the s@@ ite in the near future to ma@@ p it out.    
 And even more import@@ ant@@ ly, we have fund@@ ing to tra@@ in young Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the use of s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite technology so they can be the ones making great discover@@ ies as well.    
 So I wanted to end with my favorite qu@@ o@@ te from the M@@ iddle K@@ ing@@ dom -- it was probably writ@@ ten at the city of I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y four thous@@ and years ago.    
 "@@ S@@ har@@ ing knowledge is the greatest of all call@@ ings.    
 There's nothing like it in the lan@@ d@@ ."    
 So as it turns out, TED was not foun@@ ded in 19@@ 8@@ 4 A@@ D@@ .    
   Ma@@ king ideas actually started in 19@@ 8@@ 4 B@@ C at a no@@ t@@ -@@ lo@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ long c@@ ity, found from abo@@ ve.    
 It certainly pu@@ ts fin@@ ding se@@ ash@@ ell@@ s by the se@@ as@@ hor@@ e in perspec@@ tive.

 Oka@@ y. O@@ p@@ en your ey@@ es.    
 I want to tell you about a very bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re cont@@ est that is hel@@ d every sp@@ r@@ ing in New York C@@ ity.    
 It's called the United States M@@ e@@ mor@@ y C@@ ha@@ mp@@ i@@ on@@ shi@@ p.    
 And I had gone to co@@ ver this cont@@ est a few years back as a science jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ , expec@@ ting, I gu@@ ess, that this was going to be like the Su@@ per@@ bo@@ w@@ l of sa@@ v@@ an@@ ts.    
 This was a bunch of guys and a few la@@ di@@ es, w@@ id@@ ely v@@ ar@@ ying in both age and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ ic up@@ keep@@ .    
   They were memor@@ izing hundreds of ran@@ dom numb@@ ers, looking at them just on@@ ce.    
 They were memor@@ izing the nam@@ es of do@@ zens and do@@ zens and do@@ zens of strang@@ ers.    
 They were memor@@ izing entire po@@ em@@ s in just a few minut@@ es.    
 They were compe@@ ting to see who could memor@@ ize the order of a sh@@ u@@ ff@@ led p@@ ack of playing car@@ ds the fa@@ st@@ es@@ t.    
 I was like, this is un@@ believ@@ able.    
 These people must be f@@ rea@@ ks of natu@@ re.    
 And I started talking to a few of the compe@@ ti@@ tor@@ s.    
 This is a guy called E@@ d C@@ oo@@ k, who had come over from Eng@@ lan@@ d, where he had one of the b@@ est@@ -@@ tra@@ ined memor@@ ies.    
 And I said to him, "@@ E@@ d, when did you realize that you were a sa@@ v@@ ant@@ ?"    
 And E@@ d was like, "I'm not a sa@@ v@@ ant.    
 In fact, I have just an average memor@@ y.    
 Every@@ body who compe@@ tes in this cont@@ est will tell you that they have just an average memor@@ y.    
 We've all tra@@ ined ourselves to per@@ form these ut@@ ter@@ ly mirac@@ ul@@ ous fe@@ at@@ s of memory using a set of ancient techniqu@@ es, techniques invent@@ ed 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago in Gre@@ ec@@ e, the same techniques that C@@ ic@@ er@@ o had used to memor@@ ize his spe@@ e@@ ch@@ es, that medi@@ ev@@ al sch@@ ol@@ ars had used to memor@@ ize entire boo@@ k@@ s."    
 And I said, "@@ Wh@@ o@@ a. How come I never heard of this before@@ ?"    
 And we were standing outside the compe@@ ti@@ tion h@@ all, and E@@ d, who is a wonder@@ ful, br@@ illi@@ ant, but some@@ what ec@@ cent@@ ri@@ c Eng@@ lish gu@@ y, says to me, "@@ Jo@@ sh@@ , you're an American jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ .    
 Do you know Br@@ it@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ?"    
 I'm like, "@@ Wh@@ at@@ ? No@@ . Wh@@ y@@ ?"    
 how to memor@@ ize the order of a sh@@ u@@ ff@@ led p@@ ack of playing car@@ ds on U.S. national tel@@ e@@ vi@@ sion.    
 It will pro@@ ve to the world that anybody can do this@@ ."    
   I was like, "Well, I'm not Br@@ it@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ar@@ s, but maybe you could teach me.    
 I mean, you've got to start some@@ wher@@ e, ri@@ ght@@ ?"    
 And that was the beginning of a very str@@ ange jour@@ ney for me.    
 I ended up sp@@ ending the better part of the next year not only tra@@ ining my memor@@ y, but also inv@@ es@@ ti@@ g@@ ating it, trying to understand how it work@@ s, why it sometimes doesn't work, and what its potential might be.    
 And I met a h@@ ost of really interesting people.    
 This is a guy called E@@ .@@ P@@ .    
 the worst memory in the world.    
 H@@ is memory was so ba@@ d, that he didn't even remember he had a memory proble@@ m, which is ama@@ z@@ ing.    
 And he was this incredi@@ b@@ ly tra@@ gic figu@@ re, but he was a win@@ do@@ w into the ex@@ t@@ ent to which our memor@@ ies make us who we are.    
 At the other end of the spec@@ tru@@ m, I met this gu@@ y.    
 This is K@@ i@@ m Pe@@ e@@ k, he was the bas@@ is for D@@ us@@ ti@@ n H@@ off@@ man@@ 's charac@@ ter in the movie "@@ R@@ ain Man@@ ."    
 We spent an af@@ ter@@ no@@ on together in the S@@ al@@ t L@@ a@@ ke C@@ ity P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c Li@@ br@@ ary memor@@ izing phone boo@@ ks, which was sc@@ in@@ til@@ lat@@ ing.    
   And I went back and I read a whole h@@ ost of memory t@@ rea@@ tis@@ es, t@@ rea@@ tis@@ es writ@@ ten 2@@ ,00@@ 0@@ -@@ pl@@ us years ago in L@@ at@@ in, in an@@ ti@@ qu@@ ity, and then later, in the M@@ iddle A@@ g@@ es.    
 And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff@@ .    
 One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once up@@ on a time, this idea of having a tra@@ in@@ ed, di@@ sci@@ pl@@ in@@ ed, cul@@ tiv@@ ated memory was not nearly so ali@@ en as it would seem to us to be today.    
 O@@ n@@ ce up@@ on a time, people inv@@ es@@ ted in their memor@@ ies, in lab@@ ori@@ ously f@@ ur@@ ni@@ sh@@ ing their min@@ ds.    
 O@@ ver the last few m@@ ill@@ en@@ i@@ a, we've invent@@ ed a ser@@ ies of technologi@@ es -- from the al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ t, to the sc@@ ro@@ ll@@ , to the co@@ d@@ ex@@ , the prin@@ ting pres@@ s, photograph@@ y, the compu@@ ter, the smar@@ t@@ phone -- that have made it progres@@ si@@ vel@@ y eas@@ i@@ er and eas@@ i@@ er for us to ex@@ ter@@ nal@@ ize our memor@@ ies, for us to ess@@ entially out@@ sour@@ ce this fundamental human cap@@ ac@@ ity.    
 These technologi@@ es have made our moder@@ n world possib@@ le, but they@@ 've also changed us.    
 The@@ y@@ 've changed us cul@@ tur@@ ally, and I would argu@@ e that they@@ 've changed us cog@@ ni@@ tiv@@ el@@ y.    
 H@@ a@@ ving little need to remember any@@ mo@@ re, it sometimes seems like we've for@@ gotten h@@ ow@@ .    
 One of the last places on Earth where you still find people pas@@ sion@@ ate about this idea of a tra@@ in@@ ed, di@@ sci@@ pl@@ in@@ ed, cul@@ tiv@@ ated memor@@ y, is at this totally sing@@ ular memory cont@@ es@@ t.    
 It's actually not that sing@@ ul@@ ar, there are cont@@ es@@ ts hel@@ d all over the world.    
 And I was fascin@@ ated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it.    
 A few years back a group of rese@@ arch@@ ers at U@@ ni@@ versity C@@ ol@@ le@@ ge L@@ on@@ d@@ on brought a bunch of memory cha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons into the lab@@ .    
 They wanted to know@@ : Do these guys have bra@@ ins that are some@@ how struc@@ tur@@ ally, anatom@@ ically different from the rest of our@@ s? The answer was no@@ .    
 Are they smar@@ ter than the rest of us@@ ?    
 They gave them a bunch of cog@@ ni@@ tive tes@@ ts, and the answer was@@ : not re@@ ally.    
 There was, ho@@ we@@ ver, one really interesting and telling difference between the bra@@ ins of the memory cha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons and the control subjec@@ ts that they were com@@ par@@ ing them to.    
 When they put these guys in an f@@ M@@ R@@ I mach@@ ine, s@@ can@@ ned their bra@@ ins while they were memor@@ izing numb@@ ers and people@@ 's fac@@ es and pictures of s@@ now@@ fla@@ k@@ es, they found that the memory cha@@ mp@@ i@@ ons were li@@ gh@@ ting up different par@@ ts of the brain than everyone el@@ se.    
 O@@ f no@@ t@@ e, they were us@@ ing, or they seemed to be us@@ ing, a part of the brain that's invol@@ ved in sp@@ ati@@ al memory and na@@ vi@@ ga@@ tion.    
 Wh@@ y? And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this?    
 The sp@@ ort of compe@@ ti@@ tive memor@@ izing is dri@@ ven by a kind of ar@@ ms rac@@ e wher@@ e, every year, somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quick@@ ly, and then the rest of the fiel@@ d has to play cat@@ ch@@ -@@ up.    
 This is my friend B@@ en P@@ ri@@ d@@ mo@@ re, th@@ ree@@ -@@ time world memory cha@@ mp@@ i@@ on.    
 On his des@@ k in front of him are 3@@ 6 sh@@ u@@ ff@@ led pac@@ ks of playing car@@ ds that he is about to try to memor@@ ize in one hour@@ , using a techniqu@@ e that he invent@@ ed and he alone has ma@@ ster@@ ed.    
 He used a si@@ mil@@ ar techniqu@@ e to memor@@ ize the pre@@ ci@@ se order of 4@@ ,@@ 1@@ 40 ran@@ dom b@@ in@@ ary dig@@ its in half an hour@@ .    
   Yea@@ h.    
 And while there are a whole h@@ ost of ways of remembering stuff in these compe@@ ti@@ tions, every@@ thing, all of the techniques that are being us@@ ed, ultim@@ ately come down to a concept that psycho@@ logi@@ sts ref@@ er to as "@@ el@@ ab@@ or@@ ative enc@@ o@@ d@@ ing@@ ."    
 And it's well@@ -@@ ill@@ u@@ str@@ ated by a ni@@ f@@ ty par@@ a@@ do@@ x known as the B@@ ak@@ er@@ /@@ ba@@ k@@ er par@@ a@@ do@@ x, which goes like this: If I tell two people to remember the same wor@@ d, if I say to you, "@@ Re@@ memb@@ er that there is a guy nam@@ ed B@@ ak@@ er@@ ."    
 That's his nam@@ e.    
 And I say to you, "@@ Re@@ memb@@ er that there is a guy who is a ba@@ k@@ er@@ ."    
 Oka@@ y? And I come back to you at some point later on, and I say, "@@ Do you remember that word that I told you a while back@@ ?    
 Do you remember what it was@@ ?"    
 The person who was told his name is B@@ ak@@ er is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is a ba@@ k@@ er.    
 S@@ ame wor@@ d, different amount of rememb@@ er@@ ing@@ ; that's we@@ ir@@ d.    
 What's going on her@@ e?    
 Well, the name B@@ ak@@ er doesn't actually mean anything to you.    
 It is enti@@ rely unte@@ ther@@ ed from all of the other memor@@ ies flo@@ ating around in your sk@@ ul@@ l@@ .    
 But the comm@@ on n@@ ou@@ n "@@ ba@@ k@@ er@@ " -- we know ba@@ k@@ ers.    
 B@@ ak@@ ers wear fun@@ ny white h@@ at@@ s.    
 B@@ ak@@ ers have fl@@ our on their han@@ ds.    
 B@@ ak@@ ers sm@@ ell good when they come home from work.    
 Maybe we even know a ba@@ k@@ er.    
 And when we first hear that wor@@ d, we start putting these as@@ soci@@ a@@ tional h@@ oo@@ ks into it, that make it eas@@ i@@ er to fish it back out at some later dat@@ e.    
 The entire art of what is going on in these memory cont@@ es@@ ts, and the entire art of remembering stuff better in every@@ day life, is fi@@ g@@ ur@@ ing out ways to trans@@ form cap@@ ital B B@@ ak@@ ers into low@@ er@@ -@@ case B ba@@ k@@ ers -- to take information that is l@@ ac@@ king in cont@@ ex@@ t, in signific@@ anc@@ e, in mean@@ ing, and trans@@ form it in some way, so that it becomes mean@@ ing@@ ful in the light of all the other things One of the more el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate techniques for doing this    
 dat@@ es back 2@@ ,@@ 500 years to An@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ec@@ e.    
 It came to be known as the memory p@@ al@@ ac@@ e.    
 The story behind its cre@@ ation goes like this: There was a po@@ et called Si@@ mon@@ id@@ es, who was att@@ ending a ban@@ qu@@ e@@ t.    
 He was actually the hi@@ red enter@@ tain@@ ment, because back then, if you wanted to th@@ row a really s@@ l@@ am@@ m@@ ing part@@ y, you didn't hi@@ re a D@@ .@@ J@@ .@@ , you hi@@ red a po@@ e@@ t.    
 And he stan@@ ds up, deli@@ ver@@ s his po@@ e@@ m from memor@@ y, wal@@ ks out the do@@ or, and at the moment he do@@ es, the ban@@ qu@@ et h@@ all col@@ la@@ p@@ s@@ es.    
 K@@ ill@@ s everybody insid@@ e.    
 It doesn't just kill every@@ bod@@ y, it man@@ g@@ les the bodies beyond all recog@@ ni@@ tion.    
 No@@ body can say who was insid@@ e, no@@ body can say where they were sit@@ t@@ ing.    
 The bodies can't be proper@@ ly bu@@ ri@@ ed.    
 It's one tra@@ ge@@ dy comp@@ oun@@ ding an@@ other.    
 Si@@ mon@@ id@@ es, standing out@@ sid@@ e, the so@@ le survi@@ v@@ or am@@ id the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age, clo@@ ses his ey@@ es and has this real@@ iz@@ ation, which is that in his mind@@ 's ey@@ e, he can see where each of the gu@@ es@@ ts at the ban@@ qu@@ et had been sit@@ t@@ ing.    
 And he takes the rela@@ tiv@@ es by the han@@ d, and gu@@ id@@ es them each to their loved ones am@@ id the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age.    
 What Si@@ mon@@ id@@ es figu@@ red out at that mom@@ ent, is something that I think we all kind of intui@@ tively know, which is that, as bad as we are at remembering nam@@ es and phone numb@@ ers, and wor@@ d-@@ for@@ -@@ word in@@ struc@@ tions from our colleag@@ u@@ es, we have really excep@@ tional vi@@ su@@ al and sp@@ ati@@ al memor@@ ies.    
 If I asked you to re@@ coun@@ t the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Si@@ mon@@ id@@ es, chan@@ ces are you would have a tou@@ gh time with it.    
 But, I would wa@@ g@@ er that if I asked you to rec@@ all who is sitting on top of a talking t@@ an hor@@ se in your f@@ o@@ y@@ er right now, you would be able to see that.    
 The idea behind the memory p@@ al@@ ace is to create this imagin@@ ed edi@@ f@@ ice in your mind@@ 's ey@@ e, and pop@@ ul@@ ate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the craz@@ i@@ er, we@@ ir@@ d@@ er, more bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re, fun@@ ni@@ er, ra@@ un@@ chi@@ er, st@@ in@@ ki@@ er the image is, the more un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able it's likely to be.    
 This is adv@@ ice that goes back 2@@ ,00@@ 0@@ -@@ pl@@ us years to the earli@@ est L@@ ati@@ n memory t@@ rea@@ tis@@ es.    
 So how does this work@@ ?    
 Let's say that you've been inv@@ ited to TED cent@@ er st@@ age to give a spe@@ e@@ ch, and you want to do it from memor@@ y, if he had been inv@@ ited to TED@@ x@@ R@@ ome 2@@ ,000 years ago.    
   What you might do is picture your@@ self at the front door of your hous@@ e.    
 And you'd come up with some sort of craz@@ y, ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous, un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able imag@@ e, to re@@ mind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re cont@@ es@@ t.    
   And then you'd go inside your hous@@ e, and you would see an image of C@@ oo@@ ki@@ e M@@ on@@ ster on top of M@@ ist@@ er E@@ d.    
 And that would re@@ mind you that you would want to then intro@@ duce your friend E@@ d C@@ oo@@ k.    
 And then you'd see an image of Br@@ it@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ars to re@@ mind you of this fun@@ ny an@@ ec@@ do@@ te you want to tel@@ l@@ .    
 And you'd go into your k@@ it@@ ch@@ en, and the four@@ th top@@ ic you were going to talk about was this str@@ ange jour@@ ney that you went on for a year, and you'd have some friends to help you remember that.    
 This is how R@@ om@@ an or@@ at@@ ors memor@@ ized their spe@@ e@@ ch@@ es -- not wor@@ d-@@ for@@ -@@ wor@@ d, which is just going to scre@@ w you up, but top@@ ic@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ top@@ ic.    
 In fact, the ph@@ r@@ ase "@@ top@@ ic s@@ ent@@ enc@@ e@@ " -- that comes from the G@@ ree@@ k word "@@ top@@ os@@ ," which means "@@ plac@@ e."    
 That's a v@@ es@@ ti@@ ge of when people used to think about or@@ ator@@ y and r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic in these sorts of sp@@ ati@@ al ter@@ m@@ s.    
 The ph@@ r@@ ase "@@ in the first plac@@ e@@ ," that's like "@@ in the first place of your memory p@@ al@@ ace@@ ."    
 I thought this was just fascin@@ at@@ ing, and I got really into it.    
 And I went to a few more of these memory cont@@ es@@ ts, and I had this no@@ tion that I might write something longer about this sub@@ culture of compe@@ ti@@ tive memor@@ iz@@ ers.    
 But there was a problem.    
 The problem was that a memory cont@@ est is a pa@@ tho@@ log@@ ically bor@@ ing ev@@ ent.    
   T@@ rul@@ y, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the S@@ A@@ T@@ s -- I mean, the most drama@@ tic it gets is when somebody starts mas@@ sa@@ g@@ ing their temp@@ les.    
 And I'm a jour@@ nal@@ ist@@ , I need something to write ab@@ out.    
 I know that there's incredi@@ ble stuff happen@@ ing in these people@@ 's min@@ ds, but I don't have acc@@ ess to it.    
 And I real@@ iz@@ ed, if I was going to tell this story, I needed to walk in their sho@@ es a little b@@ it.    
 And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minut@@ es every morning, before I s@@ at down with my New York T@@ im@@ es, just trying to remember some@@ thing.    
 Maybe it was a po@@ em@@ , maybe it was nam@@ es from an old year@@ book that I b@@ ought at a f@@ le@@ a marke@@ t.    
 And I found that this was sh@@ oc@@ k@@ ingly fun@@ .    
 I never would have expec@@ ted that.    
 It was fu@@ n because this is actually not about tra@@ ining your memor@@ y.    
 What you're do@@ ing, is you're trying to get better and better at cre@@ at@@ ing, at dre@@ am@@ ing up, these ut@@ ter@@ ly lu@@ dic@@ rou@@ s, ra@@ un@@ ch@@ y, h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous, and hop@@ e@@ fully un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able images in your mind@@ 's ey@@ e.    
 And I got pretty into it.    
 This is me we@@ aring my stand@@ ard compe@@ ti@@ tive memor@@ iz@@ er@@ 's tra@@ ining k@@ it.    
 It's a pa@@ ir of ear@@ mu@@ ff@@ s and a set of sa@@ fe@@ ty go@@ gg@@ les that have been mas@@ ked over excep@@ t for two small p@@ in@@ hol@@ es, because di@@ str@@ ac@@ tion is the compe@@ ti@@ tive memor@@ iz@@ er@@ 's greatest en@@ em@@ y.    
 I ended up coming back to that same cont@@ est that I had cover@@ ed a year earli@@ er, and I had this no@@ tion that I might ent@@ er it, sort of as an experi@@ ment in partici@@ pat@@ or@@ y jour@@ nal@@ ism.    
 I@@ t@@ 'd ma@@ ke, I thought, maybe a n@@ ice ep@@ i@@ lo@@ gu@@ e to all my rese@@ arch@@ .    
 P@@ rob@@ le@@ m was, the experi@@ ment went ha@@ y@@ wi@@ re.    
 I w@@ on the cont@@ est -- which really wasn't supposed to happen@@ .    
   Now, it is n@@ ice to be able to memor@@ ize spe@@ e@@ ch@@ es and phone numb@@ ers and shop@@ ping list@@ s, but it's actually kind of b@@ es@@ ide the poin@@ t.    
 These are just tric@@ ks.    
 They work because they're based on some pretty basic prin@@ ci@@ ples about how our bra@@ ins work.    
 And you don't have to be building memory p@@ al@@ ac@@ es or memor@@ izing pac@@ ks of playing car@@ ds to bene@@ fit from a little bit of in@@ si@@ ght about how your mind work@@ s.    
 We often talk about people with great memor@@ ies as though it were some sort of an in@@ n@@ ate gi@@ f@@ t, but that is not the ca@@ se.    
 Gre@@ at memor@@ ies are lear@@ ne@@ d.    
 At the most basic level@@ , we remember when we pa@@ y att@@ en@@ tion.    
 We remember when we are deep@@ ly en@@ ga@@ ge@@ d.    
 We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experienc@@ e, and figure out why it is mean@@ ing@@ ful to us, why it is signific@@ ant, why it's color@@ ful, when we're able to trans@@ form it in some way that makes sense in the light of all of the other things flo@@ ating around in our min@@ ds, when we're able to trans@@ form B@@ ak@@ ers into ba@@ k@@ ers.    
 The memory p@@ al@@ ac@@ e, these memory techniques -- they're just sh@@ ort@@ cu@@ ts.    
 In fact, they're not even really sh@@ ort@@ cu@@ ts.    
 They work because they make you work.    
 They for@@ ce a kind of dep@@ th of process@@ ing, a kind of mind@@ ful@@ ness, that most of us don't nor@@ m@@ ally walk around ex@@ er@@ ci@@ s@@ ing.    
 But there actually are no sh@@ ort@@ cu@@ ts.    
 This is how stuff is made memor@@ able.    
 And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with@@ , it's what E@@ .@@ P@@ .@@ , the am@@ n@@ es@@ ic who couldn't even remember he had a memory proble@@ m, left me with@@ , which is the no@@ tion that our lives are the su@@ m of our memor@@ ies.    
 How much are we willing to lo@@ se from our already short liv@@ es, by lo@@ sing ourselves in our B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ri@@ es, our i@@ P@@ hon@@ es, by not pa@@ ying att@@ ention to the human being across from us who is talking with us, by being so la@@ z@@ y that we're not willing to process de@@ e@@ pl@@ y?    
 I learned fir@@ s@@ th@@ and that there are incredi@@ ble memory cap@@ ac@@ i@@ ties lat@@ ent in all of us.    
 But if you want to live a memor@@ able life, you have to be the kind of person who rememb@@ ers to rememb@@ er.    
 Thank you.    
 To@@ day I'm going to speak to you about the last 30 years of architec@@ tural hi@@ story.    
 That's a lot to p@@ ack into 1@@ 8 minut@@ es.    
 It's a complex top@@ ic, so we're just going to di@@ ve right in at a complex plac@@ e: New J@@ er@@ se@@ y.    
 Because 30 years ago, I'm from J@@ er@@ se@@ y, and I was si@@ x, and I li@@ ved there in my paren@@ t@@ s' house in a town called Li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ on, and this was my child@@ hood be@@ dro@@ om@@ .    
 A@@ rou@@ nd the cor@@ ner from my be@@ dro@@ om was the ba@@ th@@ room that I used to share with my sist@@ er.    
 And in between my be@@ dro@@ om and the ba@@ th@@ room was a bal@@ con@@ y that over@@ looked the family room.    
 And that's where everyone would han@@ g out and watch T@@ V@@ , so that every time that I walked from my be@@ dro@@ om to the ba@@ th@@ room@@ , everyone would see me, and every time I took a show@@ er and would come back in a tow@@ el, everyone would see me.    
 And I looked like this.    
 I was aw@@ k@@ war@@ d, in@@ se@@ cu@@ re, and I h@@ ated it.    
 I h@@ ated that wal@@ k, I h@@ ated that bal@@ con@@ y, I h@@ ated that room@@ , and I h@@ ated that hous@@ e.    
 And that's architec@@ ture.    
   D@@ one.    
 That feel@@ ing, those emo@@ tions that I fel@@ t, that's the power of architec@@ ture, because architec@@ ture is not about mat@@ h and it's not about z@@ on@@ ing, it's about those vis@@ cer@@ al, emo@@ tional connec@@ tions that we feel to the places that we oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y.    
 And it's no surpri@@ se that we feel that way, because acc@@ or@@ ding to the E@@ P@@ A@@ , Americ@@ ans spend 9@@ 0 percent of their time in@@ do@@ or@@ s.    
 That's 9@@ 0 percent of our time sur@@ rou@@ n@@ ded by architec@@ ture.    
 That's hu@@ g@@ e.    
 That means that architec@@ ture is sha@@ ping us in ways that we didn't even real@@ iz@@ e.    
 That makes us a little bit g@@ ul@@ li@@ ble and very, very pre@@ dic@@ tab@@ le.    
 It means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you thin@@ k@@ : You think "@@ power@@ " and "@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ it@@ y@@ " and "@@ demo@@ crac@@ y."    
 And I know you think that because it's based on a building that was build 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago by the G@@ ree@@ ks.    
 This is a tric@@ k.    
 This is a tri@@ gg@@ er that architec@@ ts use to get you to create an emo@@ tional connec@@ tion to the forms that we build our build@@ ings out of.    
 It's a pre@@ dic@@ table emo@@ tional connec@@ tion, and we've been using this tri@@ ck for a long@@ , long time.    
 We used it [@@ 200@@ ] years ago to build ban@@ ks.    
 We used it in the 19@@ th centur@@ y to build art mus@@ e@@ um@@ s.    
 And in the 20@@ th centur@@ y in Ameri@@ ca, we used it to build hous@@ es.    
 And look at these so@@ li@@ d, st@@ able little sol@@ di@@ ers fac@@ ing the oce@@ an and keep@@ ing away the el@@ em@@ ents.    
 This is re@@ ally, really us@@ e@@ ful, because building things is terri@@ f@@ y@@ ing.    
 It's exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve, it takes a long time, and it's very complic@@ ated.    
 And the people that build things -- develop@@ ers and govern@@ ments -- they're n@@ atur@@ ally afraid of inno@@ va@@ tion, and they@@ 'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respon@@ d to.    
 That's how we end up with build@@ ings like this.    
 This is a n@@ ice build@@ ing.    
 This is the Li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ on P@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c Li@@ br@@ ary that was comple@@ ted in 200@@ 4 in my home@@ tow@@ n, and, you know, it's got a d@@ ome and it's got this rou@@ nd thing and col@@ um@@ n@@ s, red bri@@ c@@ k, and you can kind of gu@@ ess what Li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ on is trying to say with this build@@ ing@@ : children, proper@@ ty valu@@ es and hi@@ story.    
 But it doesn't have much to do with what a li@@ br@@ ary actually does today.    
 That same year, in 200@@ 4@@ , on the other side of the countr@@ y, another li@@ br@@ ary was comple@@ ted, and it looks like this.    
 It's in Se@@ att@@ le.    
 This li@@ br@@ ary is about how we con@@ su@@ me media in a digital age.    
 It's about a new kind of public am@@ en@@ ity for the c@@ ity, a place to ga@@ ther and read and sha@@ re.    
 So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same countr@@ y, two build@@ ings, both called li@@ br@@ ari@@ es, look so completely differ@@ ent@@ ?    
 And the answer is that architec@@ ture wor@@ ks on the prin@@ ci@@ ple of a p@@ end@@ ul@@ u@@ m.    
 On the one side is inno@@ va@@ tion, and architec@@ ts are con@@ stan@@ tly push@@ ing, push@@ ing for new technologi@@ es, new ty@@ po@@ logi@@ es, new solu@@ tions for the way that we live today.    
 And we pus@@ h and we pus@@ h and we pus@@ h until we completely ali@@ en@@ ate all of you.    
 We wear all bl@@ ac@@ k, we get very de@@ pres@@ se@@ d, you think we're ad@@ or@@ able, we're de@@ ad inside because we've got no choic@@ e.    
 We have to go to the other side and re@@ eng@@ age those sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ s that we know you lo@@ ve.    
 So we do that, and you're happ@@ y, we feel like sel@@ l@@ out@@ s, so we start experi@@ ment@@ ing again and we pus@@ h the p@@ end@@ ul@@ um back and back and for@@ th and back and for@@ th we've gone for the last 3@@ 00 years, and certainly for the last 30 years.    
 Oka@@ y, 30 years ago we were coming out of the '@@ 7@@ 0@@ s.    
 Ar@@ ch@@ itec@@ ts had been bus@@ y experi@@ ment@@ ing with something called br@@ u@@ tal@@ ism.    
 It's about concre@@ t@@ e.    
   You can gu@@ ess this.    
 S@@ m@@ all win@@ dow@@ s, de@@ human@@ izing scal@@ e.    
 This is really tou@@ gh stuff@@ .    
 So as we get clo@@ s@@ er to the '@@ 80@@ s, we start to re@@ eng@@ age those sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ s.    
 We pus@@ h the p@@ end@@ ul@@ um back into the other direc@@ tion.    
 We take these forms that we know you love and we up@@ d@@ ate them.    
 We ad@@ d ne@@ on and we ad@@ d pa@@ st@@ el@@ s and we use new materi@@ als.    
 And you love it.    
 And we can't give you enough of it.    
 We take C@@ hi@@ pp@@ end@@ al@@ e ar@@ mo@@ i@@ res and we turned those into sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ per@@ s, and sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ per@@ s can be medi@@ ev@@ al ca@@ st@@ les made out of g@@ las@@ s.    
 F@@ or@@ ms got bi@@ g, forms got bo@@ ld and color@@ ful.    
 D@@ war@@ ves became col@@ um@@ n@@ s.    
   S@@ wan@@ s grew to the si@@ ze of build@@ ings.    
 It was craz@@ y.    
 But it's the '@@ 80@@ s, it's co@@ ol@@ .    
   We're all han@@ g@@ ing out in m@@ all@@ s and we're all moving to the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s, and out there, out in the sub@@ ur@@ b@@ s, we can create our own architec@@ tural f@@ ant@@ as@@ ies.    
 And those f@@ ant@@ as@@ ies, they can be M@@ ed@@ it@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an or F@@ ren@@ ch or Ital@@ i@@ an.    
   P@@ os@@ sib@@ ly with end@@ less b@@ read@@ s@@ tic@@ ks.    
 This is the thing about po@@ st@@ moder@@ n@@ ism.    
 This is the thing about sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ s.    
 They're eas@@ y, they're chea@@ p, because instead of making plac@@ es, we're making memor@@ ies of plac@@ es.    
 Because I know, and I know all of you know, this isn't T@@ us@@ can@@ y.    
 This is O@@ hi@@ o.    
   So architec@@ ts get fru@@ str@@ ated, and we start push@@ ing the p@@ end@@ ul@@ um back into the other direc@@ tion.    
 In the l@@ ate '@@ 80@@ s and ear@@ ly '@@ 9@@ 0@@ s, we start experi@@ ment@@ ing with something called de@@ construc@@ tiv@@ ism.    
 We th@@ row out hi@@ stor@@ ical sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ s, we rely on new@@ , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ a@@ ided design techniqu@@ es, and we come up with new comp@@ os@@ i@@ tions, forms cr@@ ash@@ ing into for@@ m@@ s.    
 This is a@@ ca@@ de@@ mi@@ c and head@@ y stuff@@ , it's su@@ per un@@ pop@@ ul@@ ar, we totally ali@@ en@@ ate you.    
 O@@ r@@ d@@ in@@ ar@@ il@@ y, the p@@ end@@ ul@@ um would just s@@ w@@ ing back into the other direc@@ tion.    
 And then, something amazing happen@@ ed.    
 In 19@@ 9@@ 7@@ , this building op@@ en@@ ed.    
 This is the G@@ u@@ g@@ gen@@ he@@ i@@ m B@@ il@@ ba@@ o, by Fran@@ k G@@ e@@ h@@ r@@ y.    
 And this building fundament@@ ally changes the world@@ 's relationship to architec@@ ture.    
 P@@ au@@ l G@@ old@@ b@@ erg@@ er said that B@@ il@@ ba@@ o was one of those r@@ are moments when cri@@ tic@@ s, a@@ ca@@ de@@ mic@@ s, and the gener@@ al public were completely un@@ ited around a build@@ ing.    
 The New York T@@ im@@ es called this building a mirac@@ le.    
 T@@ ou@@ ris@@ m in B@@ il@@ ba@@ o increas@@ ed 2@@ ,@@ 500 percent after this building was comple@@ ted.    
 So all of a sudd@@ en, everybody wan@@ ts one of these build@@ ing@@ s: L@@ .@@ A@@ .@@ , Se@@ att@@ le, C@@ hi@@ ca@@ go@@ , New Yor@@ k, C@@ level@@ and, S@@ p@@ r@@ ing@@ fiel@@ d.    
   Every@@ body wan@@ ts one, and G@@ e@@ h@@ ry is every@@ wher@@ e.    
 He is our very first star@@ ch@@ itec@@ t.    
 Now, how is it possible that these forms -- they're w@@ il@@ d and radi@@ cal -- how is it possible that they become so u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous through@@ out the worl@@ d?    
 And it happened because media so success@@ fully g@@ al@@ v@@ an@@ ized around them that they quick@@ ly taught us that these forms mean culture and tou@@ ri@@ sm@@ .    
 We created an emo@@ tional reac@@ tion to these for@@ m@@ s.    
 So did every ma@@ y@@ or in the world.    
 So every ma@@ y@@ or knew that if they had these for@@ ms, they had culture and tou@@ ri@@ sm@@ .    
 This ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on at the turn of the new m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um happened to a few other star@@ ch@@ itec@@ ts.    
 It happened to Z@@ a@@ h@@ a and it happened to Li@@ b@@ es@@ kin@@ d, and what happened to these el@@ ite few architec@@ ts at the turn of the new m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ um could actually start to happen to the entire fiel@@ d of architec@@ ture, as digital media starts to increase the spe@@ ed with which we con@@ su@@ me information.    
 Because think about how you con@@ su@@ me architec@@ ture.    
 A thous@@ and years ago, you would have had to have walked to the v@@ il@@ la@@ ge next door to see a build@@ ing.    
 T@@ ran@@ sp@@ or@@ ta@@ tion spe@@ eds up@@ : You can take a bo@@ at, you can take a plan@@ e, you can be a tou@@ ri@@ st.    
 T@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ logy spe@@ eds up@@ : You can see it in a new@@ sp@@ a@@ per@@ , on T@@ V@@ , until finally, we are all architec@@ tural photograph@@ ers, and the building has become dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died from the sit@@ e.    
 Ar@@ ch@@ itec@@ ture is every@@ where now, and that means that the spe@@ ed of communi@@ cation has finally caught up to the spe@@ ed of architec@@ ture.    
 Because architec@@ ture actually mo@@ ves quite quick@@ ly.    
 It doesn't take long to think about a build@@ ing.    
 It takes a long time to build a build@@ ing, three or four years, and in the inter@@ im@@ , an architec@@ t will design two or eight or a hundred other build@@ ings before they know if that building that they desig@@ ned four years ago was a success or no@@ t.    
 That's because there's never been a good fe@@ ed@@ back loo@@ p in architec@@ ture.    
 That's how we end up with build@@ ings like this.    
 B@@ ru@@ tal@@ ism wasn't a tw@@ o@@ -@@ year mov@@ em@@ ent, it was a 20@@ -@@ year mov@@ em@@ ent.    
 For 20 years, we were produc@@ ing build@@ ings like this because we had no idea how much you h@@ ated it.    
 It's never going to happen again, I think, because we are living on the ver@@ ge of the greatest re@@ volu@@ tion in architec@@ ture since the inv@@ ention of concre@@ t@@ e, of ste@@ el, or of the el@@ ev@@ at@@ or, and it's a media re@@ volu@@ tion.    
 So my theor@@ y is that when you app@@ ly media to this p@@ end@@ ul@@ u@@ m, it starts s@@ w@@ ing@@ ing faster and fa@@ st@@ er, until it's at both ex@@ trem@@ es nearly si@@ mul@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous@@ ly, and that effec@@ tively bl@@ ur@@ s the difference between inno@@ v@@ ation and sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ , between us, the architec@@ ts, and you, the pub@@ lic@@ .    
 Now we can make nearly instan@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous, emo@@ tion@@ ally char@@ ged sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ s out of something that's brand new@@ .    
 L@@ et me show you how this pla@@ ys out in a project that my fir@@ m rec@@ ently comple@@ ted.    
 We were hi@@ red to re@@ place this build@@ ing, which bur@@ ned dow@@ n.    
 This is the cent@@ er of a town called the P@@ ines in F@@ i@@ re I@@ s@@ land in New York St@@ ate.    
 It's a va@@ cation commun@@ ity.    
 We pro@@ pos@@ ed a building that was au@@ d@@ ac@@ i@@ ous, that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to, and we were s@@ ca@@ red and our cli@@ ent was s@@ ca@@ red and the community was s@@ care@@ d, so we created a ser@@ ies of photo@@ real@@ istic ren@@ der@@ ings that we put onto F@@ ace@@ book and we put onto In@@ st@@ ag@@ r@@ am, and we let people start to do what they do@@ : share it, com@@ ment, like it, h@@ ate it.    
 But that me@@ ant that two years before the building was comple@@ t@@ e, it was already a part of the commun@@ ity, so that when the ren@@ der@@ ings looked exactly like the fin@@ ish@@ ed produc@@ t, there were no surpri@@ s@@ es.    
 This building was already a part of this commun@@ ity, and then that first sum@@ m@@ er, when people started arri@@ ving and sh@@ aring the building on social medi@@ a, the building c@@ eas@@ ed to be just an edi@@ f@@ ice and it became medi@@ a, because thes@@ e, these are not just pictures of a build@@ ing, they're your pictures of a build@@ ing.    
 And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of your person@@ al nar@@ ra@@ tive, and what you're doing is you're sh@@ ort@@ -@@ cir@@ cu@@ iting all of our collec@@ tive memor@@ y, and you're making these char@@ ged sy@@ mb@@ ol@@ s for us to under@@ stan@@ d.    
 That means we don't need the G@@ ree@@ ks any@@ more to tell us what to think about architec@@ ture.    
 We can tell each other what we think about architec@@ ture, because digital media ha@@ s@@ n't just changed the relationship between all of us, it's changed the relationship between us and build@@ ings.    
 Th@@ ink for a second about those li@@ br@@ ari@@ ans back in Li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ on.    
 If that building was going to be built today, the first thing they would do is go online and se@@ arch "@@ new li@@ br@@ ari@@ es@@ ."    
 They would be b@@ om@@ bar@@ ded by exam@@ ples of experi@@ ment@@ ation, of inno@@ va@@ tion, of push@@ ing at the en@@ velop@@ e of what a li@@ br@@ ary can be.    
 That's am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion.    
 That's am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion that they can take with them to the ma@@ y@@ or of Li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ on, to the people of Li@@ v@@ ing@@ st@@ on, and say, there's no one answer to what a li@@ br@@ ary is today.    
 Let's be a part of this.    
 This ab@@ und@@ ance of experi@@ ment@@ ation gi@@ ves them the freedom to run their own experi@@ ment.    
 Every@@ thing is different now.    
 Ar@@ ch@@ itec@@ ts are no longer these myster@@ i@@ ous creatu@@ res that use big words and complicated dra@@ w@@ ings, and you aren't the ha@@ pl@@ ess pub@@ lic@@ , the con@@ sum@@ er that won@@ 't acc@@ ept anything that they haven't seen any@@ more.    
 Ar@@ ch@@ itec@@ ts can hear you, and you're not in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated by architec@@ ture.    
 That means that that p@@ end@@ ul@@ um s@@ w@@ ing@@ ing back and for@@ th from st@@ y@@ le to st@@ y@@ le, from mov@@ ement to mov@@ em@@ ent, is ir@@ rele@@ v@@ ant.    
 We can actually move forward and find rele@@ v@@ ant solu@@ tions to the problems that our society fac@@ es.    
 This is the end of architec@@ tural hi@@ story, and it means that the build@@ ings of tom@@ or@@ row are going to look a lot different than the build@@ ings of today.    
 It means that a public space in the ancient city of S@@ ev@@ il@@ le can be unique and ta@@ i@@ lo@@ red to the way that a moder@@ n city work@@ s.    
 It means that a sta@@ di@@ um in B@@ roo@@ k@@ ly@@ n can be a sta@@ di@@ um in B@@ roo@@ k@@ ly@@ n, not some re@@ d-@@ bri@@ ck hi@@ stor@@ ical pas@@ ti@@ ch@@ e of what we think a sta@@ di@@ um ought to be.    
 It means that robo@@ ts are going to build our build@@ ings, because we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produc@@ e.    
 And it means that build@@ ings will tw@@ ist to the wh@@ im@@ s of nature instead of the other way aroun@@ d.    
 It means that a par@@ king gar@@ age in Mi@@ am@@ i Be@@ ach@@ , F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ a, can also be a place for sp@@ or@@ ts and for y@@ o@@ g@@ a and you can even get married there l@@ ate at ni@@ ght.    
   It means that three architec@@ ts can dream about s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing in the E@@ ast Ri@@ ver of New Yor@@ k, and then ra@@ ise nearly half a million dollars from a community that ga@@ ther@@ ed around their cause, no one cli@@ ent any@@ more.    
 It means that no building is too small for inno@@ va@@ tion, like this little re@@ in@@ de@@ er pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on that's as mus@@ c@@ ly and s@@ ine@@ w@@ y as the anim@@ als it's desig@@ ned to ob@@ ser@@ ve.    
 And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful to be lo@@ v@@ able, like this u@@ g@@ ly little building in S@@ pa@@ in, where the architec@@ ts du@@ g a ho@@ le, pac@@ ked it with ha@@ y, and then p@@ ou@@ red concre@@ te around it, and when the concre@@ te dri@@ ed, they inv@@ ited someone to come and clean that ha@@ y out so that all that's left when it's done is this h@@ ide@@ ous little room that's f@@ ill@@ ed with the imp@@ rin@@ ts and sc@@ r@@ at@@ ch@@ es of how that place was ma@@ de,    
 and that becomes the most sub@@ li@@ me place to watch a S@@ pan@@ ish sun@@ se@@ t.    
 Because it doesn't matter if a c@@ ow buil@@ ds our build@@ ings or a robo@@ t buil@@ ds our build@@ ings.    
 It doesn't matter how we buil@@ d, it mat@@ ters what we buil@@ d.    
 Ar@@ ch@@ itec@@ ts already know how to make build@@ ings that are gre@@ en@@ er and smar@@ ter and friend@@ li@@ er.    
 We've just been wa@@ iting for all of you to want them.    
 And finally, we're not on op@@ pos@@ ite sid@@ es any@@ more.    
 F@@ ind an architec@@ t, hi@@ re an architec@@ t, work with us to design better build@@ ings, better ci@@ ties, and a better world, because the sta@@ kes are high@@ .    
 Bu@@ il@@ d@@ ings don't just ref@@ le@@ ct our societ@@ y, they shape our society down to the sm@@ all@@ est spac@@ es@@ : the local li@@ br@@ ari@@ es, the hom@@ es where we ra@@ ise our children, and the walk that they take from the be@@ dro@@ om to the ba@@ th@@ room.    
 Thank you.    
 This is my ni@@ ec@@ e, S@@ tel@@ la@@ .    
 S@@ he's just turned one and started to wal@@ k.    
 And she's walking in that really c@@ ool way that one@@ -year-@@ ol@@ ds do, a kind of te@@ e@@ ter@@ ing, my@@ -@@ bod@@ y@@ '@@ s@@ -@@ mov@@ ing@@ - too@@ -@@ fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ my@@ -@@ leg@@ s kind of way.    
 It is absolutely g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous.    
 And one of her favorite things to do at the moment is to st@@ are at her@@ self in the mir@@ r@@ or.    
 She absolutely lo@@ ves her ref@@ lec@@ tion.    
 She gi@@ gg@@ les and squ@@ e@@ als, and gi@@ ves her@@ self these bi@@ g, we@@ t k@@ is@@ s@@ es.    
 It is beauti@@ ful.    
 A@@ pp@@ aren@@ t@@ ly, all of her friends do this and my mo@@ m tel@@ ls me that I used to do this, and it got me thin@@ k@@ ing@@ : When did I stop doing this?    
 When is it suddenly not oka@@ y to love the way that we loo@@ k@@ ?    
 Because app@@ aren@@ tly we don@@ '@@ t.    
 T@@ en thous@@ and people every mon@@ th goo@@ g@@ le, "A@@ m I u@@ g@@ ly@@ ?"    
 This is F@@ ay@@ e. F@@ ay@@ e is 1@@ 3 and she lives in D@@ en@@ ver.    
 And like any te@@ en@@ ag@@ er, she just wan@@ ts to be li@@ ked and to fit in.    
 It's S@@ un@@ day ni@@ ght.    
 S@@ he's getting ready for the week a@@ head at school.    
 And she's sli@@ ght@@ ly d@@ reading it, and she's a bit conf@@ used because des@@ p@@ ite her mo@@ m telling her all the time that she's beauti@@ ful, every day at school, someone tel@@ ls her that she's u@@ g@@ ly.    
 Because of the difference between what her mo@@ m tel@@ ls her and what her friends at school, or her pe@@ ers at school are telling her, she doesn't know who to believ@@ e.    
 So, she takes a video of her@@ self. She po@@ sts it to You@@ T@@ u@@ be and she as@@ ks people to please leave a com@@ ment@@ : "A@@ m I pretty or am I u@@ g@@ ly@@ ?"    
 Well, so far@@ , F@@ ay@@ e has recei@@ ved over 1@@ 3@@ ,000 com@@ ment@@ s.    
 Some of them are so na@@ st@@ y, they don't be@@ ar thinking ab@@ out.    
 This is an aver@@ age, health@@ y@@ -@@ looking te@@ en@@ age girl recei@@ ving this fe@@ ed@@ back at one of the most emo@@ tion@@ ally vul@@ ner@@ able times in her life.    
 Th@@ ous@@ ands of people are po@@ sting vide@@ os like this, mo@@ st@@ ly te@@ en@@ age girl@@ s, reach@@ ing out in this way.    
 But what's lead@@ ing them to do this?    
 Well, to@@ da@@ y's te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers are ra@@ rely al@@ one.    
 They're under pres@@ sure to be online and avail@@ able at all times, tal@@ king, messa@@ g@@ ing, lik@@ ing, com@@ ment@@ ing, sh@@ ar@@ ing, po@@ sting — it never end@@ s.    
 N@@ ever before have we been so connec@@ ted, so contin@@ u@@ ous@@ ly, so instan@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous@@ ly, so youn@@ g@@ .    
 And as one mo@@ m told me, it's like there's a par@@ ty in their be@@ dro@@ om every ni@@ ght.    
 There's simply no pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y.    
 And the social pres@@ su@@ res that go along with that are rel@@ ent@@ l@@ ess.    
 This al@@ wa@@ y@@ s@@ -@@ on environment is tra@@ ining our kids to value themselves based on the number of li@@ kes they get and the types of com@@ ments that they recei@@ ve.    
 There's no se@@ par@@ ation between online and off@@ line life.    
 What's real or what isn't is really hard to tell the difference betwe@@ en.    
 And it's also really hard to tell the difference between what's au@@ th@@ enti@@ c and what's dig@@ it@@ ally man@@ i@@ pul@@ ated.    
 What's a high@@ light in some@@ one's life ver@@ su@@ s what's nor@@ mal in the cont@@ ext of every@@ day.    
 And where are they looking to for inspi@@ ra@@ tion@@ ?    
 Well, you can see the kinds of images that are cover@@ ing the new@@ s@@ fe@@ eds of girls today.    
 S@@ ize zer@@ o model@@ s still dom@@ in@@ ate our cat@@ wal@@ ks.    
 A@@ ir@@ br@@ us@@ h@@ ing is now rou@@ tin@@ e.    
 And t@@ ren@@ ds like #@@ thin@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion, #@@ thi@@ gh@@ ga@@ p, #@@ bi@@ kin@@ i@@ bridge and #@@ pro@@ an@@ a.    
 For those who don't know, #@@ pro@@ an@@ a means pro@@ -@@ an@@ ore@@ x@@ i@@ a.    
 These t@@ ren@@ ds are te@@ am@@ ed with the ster@@ e@@ o@@ ty@@ ping and fla@@ gr@@ ant objec@@ ti@@ fi@@ cation of women in to@@ da@@ y's pop@@ ular cul@@ ture.    
 It is not hard to see what girls are b@@ en@@ ch@@ mar@@ king themselves again@@ st.    
 But bo@@ ys are not im@@ m@@ un@@ e to this ei@@ ther@@ .    
 A@@ spir@@ ing to the ch@@ is@@ el@@ ed j@@ a@@ w lin@@ es and ri@@ pped six pac@@ ks of super@@ her@@ o@@ -@@ like sp@@ or@@ ts star@@ s and play@@ boy music arti@@ st@@ s.    
 But, what's the problem with all of this?    
 Well, su@@ rely we want our kids to grow up as health@@ y, well bal@@ anc@@ ed individu@@ als.    
 But in an i@@ ma@@ ge@@ -@@ ob@@ s@@ ess@@ ed cul@@ ture, we are tra@@ ining our kids to spend more time and mental eff@@ ort on their appe@@ ar@@ ance at the exp@@ en@@ se of all of the other as@@ pec@@ ts of their identi@@ ties.    
 So, things like their relationshi@@ ps, the development of their physical ab@@ ili@@ ties, and their stu@@ dies and so on begin to suffer@@ .    
 Si@@ x out of 10 girls are now choos@@ ing not to do something because they don't think they look good enou@@ gh@@ .    
 These are not tri@@ vi@@ al ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties.    
 These are fundamental ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties to their development as human@@ s and as con@@ tribu@@ tors to society and to the work@@ forc@@ e.    
 Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ one perc@@ ent, nearly one in three te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers, are with@@ dra@@ w@@ ing from clas@@ s@@ room de@@ bat@@ e. They're fail@@ ing to eng@@ age in clas@@ s@@ room de@@ b@@ ate because they don't want to dra@@ w att@@ ention to the way that they loo@@ k.    
 One in five are not showing up to class at all on days when they don't feel good about it.    
 And when it comes to exam@@ s, if you don't think you look good enou@@ gh, speci@@ fic@@ ally if you don't think you are th@@ in enou@@ gh, you will sc@@ or@@ e a low@@ er gra@@ de point average And this is con@@ sist@@ ent across F@@ in@@ lan@@ d, the U.S.    
 and Chin@@ a, and is tru@@ e re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of how much you actually we@@ i@@ gh@@ .    
 So to be su@@ per c@@ lear@@ , we're talking about the way you think you loo@@ k, not how you actually loo@@ k.    
 L@@ ow body conf@@ idence is under@@ min@@ ing a@@ ca@@ de@@ mi@@ c achiev@@ em@@ ent.    
 But it's also da@@ mag@@ ing heal@@ th.    
 T@@ e@@ en@@ ag@@ ers with low body conf@@ idence do less physical ac@@ tiv@@ ity, e@@ at less fru@@ its and ve@@ ge@@ tab@@ l@@ es, par@@ take in more un@@ health@@ y we@@ ight control prac@@ tic@@ es that can le@@ ad to e@@ ating di@@ sor@@ der@@ s.    
 They have low@@ er self-@@ es@@ te@@ em@@ .    
 They're more eas@@ ily in@@ flu@@ enc@@ ed by people around them and they're at great@@ er ris@@ k of de@@ pres@@ sion.    
 And we think it's for all of these reas@@ ons that they take more ris@@ ks with things like al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and d@@ ru@@ g us@@ e@@ ; cr@@ as@@ h di@@ et@@ ing@@ ; c@@ os@@ me@@ tic surg@@ er@@ y@@ ; un@@ prote@@ c@@ ted, earli@@ er sex@@ ; and self-@@ har@@ m.    
 The pur@@ su@@ it of the perfect body is putting pres@@ sure on our health@@ care systems and co@@ sting our govern@@ ments billi@@ ons of dollars every year.    
 And we don't grow out of it.    
 W@@ om@@ en who think they're over@@ we@@ ight — again, re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether they are or are not — have high@@ er r@@ ates of ab@@ s@@ ent@@ e@@ e@@ ism.    
 S@@ ev@@ ent@@ e@@ en percent of women would a day when they weren't feeling conf@@ id@@ ent about the way that they loo@@ k.    
 H@@ a@@ ve a think about what this is doing to our econom@@ y.    
 If we could over@@ come this, what that opportunity looks lik@@ e.    
 Un@@ loc@@ king this potential is in the inter@@ est of every single one of us.    
 But how do we do that?    
 Well, tal@@ king, on its ow@@ n, only gets you so far@@ .    
 It's not enough by it@@ self.    
 If you actually want to make a differ@@ ence, you have to do some@@ thing.    
 And we've learned there are three key wa@@ y@@ s: The first is we have to educ@@ ate for body conf@@ id@@ ence.    
 We have to help our te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers de@@ vel@@ op str@@ at@@ e@@ gi@@ es to over@@ come i@@ ma@@ ge@@ -@@ rel@@ ated pres@@ su@@ res and build their self-@@ es@@ te@@ em@@ .    
 Now, the good news is that there are many progr@@ ams out there avail@@ able to do this.    
 The bad news is that most of them don't work.    
 I was sh@@ oc@@ ked to learn that many well@@ -@@ mean@@ ing progr@@ ams are in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently actually making the situation wor@@ se. So we need to make d@@ am@@ n sure that the progr@@ ams that our kids are recei@@ ving are not only having a posi@@ tive imp@@ ac@@ t, but having a la@@ sting impact as well.    
 And the research show@@ s that the best progr@@ ams ad@@ dres@@ s six key are@@ as@@ : The first is the in@@ flu@@ ence of family, friends and relationshi@@ p@@ s.    
 The second is media and c@@ ele@@ br@@ ity cul@@ ture, then how to hand@@ le te@@ as@@ ing and bul@@ ly@@ ing, the way we compe@@ te and comp@@ are with one another based on loo@@ ks, talking about appe@@ ar@@ ance — some people call this "@@ body tal@@ k@@ " or "@@ f@@ at tal@@ k@@ " — and finally, the foun@@ da@@ tions of res@@ pec@@ ting and looking after your@@ self.    
 These six things are cru@@ ci@@ al starting poin@@ ts for anyone seri@@ ous about deli@@ ver@@ ing bod@@ y@@ -@@ conf@@ idence edu@@ cation that work@@ s.    
 A@@ n edu@@ cation is cri@@ tic@@ al, but t@@ ack@@ ling this problem is going to re@@ qui@@ re each and everyone of us for the women and girls in our own lives.    
 Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing the st@@ at@@ us qu@@ o of how women are seen and talked about in our own cir@@ cl@@ es.    
 It is not oka@@ y that we judge the con@@ tribu@@ tion of our poli@@ tici@@ ans by their ha@@ ir@@ cu@@ ts or the si@@ ze of their brea@@ sts, or to in@@ f@@ er that the de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation or the success of an O@@ ly@@ mp@@ ian is down to her not being a loo@@ k@@ er.    
 We need to start judg@@ ing people by what they do, not what they look lik@@ e.    
 We can all start by taking respon@@ sib@@ ility for the types of pictures and com@@ ments that we p@@ ost on our own social net@@ work@@ s.    
 We can comp@@ li@@ ment people based on their eff@@ ort and their ac@@ tions and not on their appe@@ ar@@ anc@@ e.    
 And let me ask you, when was the last time that you k@@ is@@ sed a mir@@ ror@@ ?    
 U@@ l@@ tim@@ ately, we need to work together as communi@@ ties, as govern@@ ments and as busin@@ ess@@ es to really change this culture of our@@ s so that our kids grow up valu@@ ing their whole selv@@ es, valu@@ ing individu@@ al@@ ity, di@@ vers@@ ity, incl@@ usi@@ on.    
 We need to put the people that are making a real difference on our pe@@ des@@ tal@@ s, making a difference in the real world.    
 G@@ i@@ ving them the air@@ time, because only then will we create a different world.    
 A world where our kids are free to become the best ver@@ sions of them@@ selv@@ es, where the way they think they look never hol@@ ds them back from being who they are or achiev@@ ing what they want in life.    
 Th@@ ink about what this might mean for someone in your life.    
 Who have you got in min@@ d?    
 Is it your wi@@ fe@@ ?    
 Y@@ our si@@ ster@@ ?    
 Y@@ our daugh@@ ter@@ ?    
 Y@@ our ni@@ ec@@ e?    
 Y@@ our friend@@ ? It could just be the woman a couple of se@@ at@@ s away from you today.    
 What would it mean for her if she were fre@@ ed from that vo@@ ice of her inner cri@@ tic@@ , n@@ ag@@ g@@ ing her to have longer leg@@ s, thin@@ ner thi@@ gh@@ s, sm@@ all@@ er st@@ om@@ ach@@ , shor@@ ter fe@@ et@@ ?    
 What could it mean for her if we over@@ came this and un@@ loc@@ ked her potential in that wa@@ y?    
 Ri@@ ght now, our cul@@ ture@@ 's ob@@ ses@@ sion with image is hol@@ ding us all back.    
 But let's show our kids the tru@@ th.    
 Let's show them that the way you look is just one part of your identity and that the truth is we love them for who they are and what they do and how they make us feel@@ .    
 Let's build self-@@ es@@ te@@ e@@ m into our school cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um@@ s.    
 Let's each and every one of us change the way we talk and comp@@ are ourselves to other people.    
 And let's work together as communi@@ ties, from gr@@ as@@ s@@ roo@@ ts to govern@@ ment@@ s, so that the happy little one@@ -year-@@ ol@@ ds of today become the conf@@ id@@ ent chan@@ ge@@ ma@@ k@@ ers of tom@@ or@@ row@@ .    
 Let's do this.    
 On No@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 5@@ th, 19@@ 9@@ 0, a man nam@@ ed E@@ l@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air walked into a ho@@ te@@ l in Man@@ h@@ att@@ an and as@@ s@@ as@@ sin@@ ated R@@ ab@@ b@@ i M@@ e@@ ir K@@ a@@ han@@ e, the lead@@ er of the J@@ ew@@ ish D@@ e@@ f@@ en@@ se Le@@ ag@@ u@@ e.    
 N@@ os@@ air was initi@@ ally found not gu@@ il@@ ty of the m@@ ur@@ d@@ er, but while ser@@ ving time on less@@ er char@@ g@@ es, he and other men began plan@@ ning att@@ ac@@ ks on a do@@ z@@ en New York C@@ ity lan@@ d@@ mar@@ ks, including tun@@ n@@ el@@ s, syn@@ ago@@ gu@@ es and the United Na@@ tions head@@ quar@@ ters.    
 Th@@ an@@ k@@ ful@@ ly, those plan@@ s were f@@ o@@ il@@ ed by an F@@ B@@ I infor@@ man@@ t.    
 S@@ ad@@ ly, the 19@@ 9@@ 3 b@@ om@@ bing of the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ ent@@ er was no@@ t.    
 N@@ os@@ air would even@@ tu@@ ally be con@@ vic@@ ted for his invol@@ v@@ ement in the p@@ lo@@ t.    
 E@@ l@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father@@ .    
 I was born in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh, P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a in 19@@ 8@@ 3 to him, an Egyp@@ ti@@ an engine@@ er, and a lo@@ ving American mother and gra@@ de school teach@@ er, who together tried their best to create a happy child@@ hood for me.    
 It wasn't until I was seven years old that our family dy@@ nam@@ ic started to change.    
 My father ex@@ pos@@ ed me to a side of I@@ sla@@ m that few people, including the maj@@ or@@ ity of M@@ us@@ lim@@ s, get to se@@ e.    
 It's been my experience that when people take the time to inter@@ act with one an@@ other@@ , it doesn't take long to realize that for the most par@@ t, we all want the same things out of life.    
 H@@ o@@ we@@ ver, in every reli@@ gi@@ on, in every popula@@ tion, you'll find a small perc@@ ent@@ age of people who hold so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beli@@ e@@ f@@ s that they feel they must use any means necess@@ ary to make other@@ s live as they do.    
 A few months pri@@ or to his ar@@ re@@ st, he s@@ at me down and expla@@ ined that for the past few wee@@ k@@ end@@ s, he and some friends had been going to a sh@@ oo@@ ting ran@@ ge on L@@ ong I@@ s@@ land for target prac@@ tic@@ e.    
 He told me I'd be going with him the next mor@@ n@@ ing.    
 We arri@@ ved at C@@ al@@ ver@@ t@@ on Sh@@ oo@@ ting R@@ ang@@ e, which un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to our group was being wat@@ ched by the F@@ B@@ I@@ .    
 When it was my turn to sh@@ oo@@ t, my father helped me hold the ri@@ f@@ le to my sh@@ oul@@ der and expla@@ ined how to ai@@ m at the target about 30 y@@ ar@@ ds off.    
 That day, the last bul@@ let I sho@@ t hit the small or@@ ange light that s@@ at on top of the target and to every@@ one's surpri@@ se, especially min@@ e, the entire target bur@@ st into fl@@ am@@ es.    
 My un@@ cle turned to the other m@@ en, and in Ar@@ ab@@ ic said, "@@ I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h@@ ."    
 Li@@ ke father@@ , like s@@ on.    
 They all seemed to get a really big la@@ u@@ gh out of that com@@ ment, but it wasn't until a few years later that I fully underst@@ ood what they thought was so fun@@ n@@ y.    
 They thought they saw in me the same des@@ truc@@ tion my father was cap@@ able of.    
 Th@@ ose men would even@@ tu@@ ally be con@@ vic@@ ted of plac@@ ing a v@@ an f@@ ill@@ ed with 1@@ ,@@ 500 p@@ oun@@ ds of explo@@ si@@ ves into the sub@@ -@@ level par@@ king lot of the World T@@ ra@@ de C@@ enter@@ 's North T@@ ow@@ er, ca@@ using an explo@@ sion that killed six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1@@ ,000 other@@ s.    
 These were the men I looked up to.    
 These were the men I called am@@ mu@@ , which means un@@ c@@ le.    
 By the time I turned 19@@ , I had already moved 20 times in my life, and that in@@ st@@ ability during my child@@ hood didn't really provid@@ e an opportunity to make many friend@@ s.    
 E@@ ach time I would begin to feel comfor@@ table around some@@ one, it was time to p@@ ack up and move to the next tow@@ n.    
 Be@@ ing the per@@ pe@@ tu@@ al new face in clas@@ s, I was fre@@ qu@@ ently the target of bul@@ li@@ es.    
 I k@@ ept my identity a secre@@ t from my clas@@ s@@ mat@@ es to a@@ vo@@ id being tar@@ ge@@ ted, but as it turns out, being the qui@@ e@@ t, ch@@ u@@ b@@ by new kid in class was more than enough am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion.    
 So for the most par@@ t, I spent my time at home reading books and watching T@@ V or playing video gam@@ es.    
 For those reas@@ on@@ s, my social sk@@ ill@@ s were l@@ ac@@ king, to say the lea@@ st, and growing up in a bi@@ go@@ ted h@@ ou@@ se@@ hol@@ d, I wasn't pre@@ pa@@ red for the real world.    
 I'd been rais@@ ed to judge people like a person@@ 's rac@@ e or reli@@ gi@@ on.    
 So what op@@ ened my ey@@ es?    
 One of my first experienc@@ es that challeng@@ ed this way of thinking was during the 200@@ 0 pres@@ identi@@ al elec@@ tions.    
 Th@@ rou@@ gh a colle@@ ge pre@@ p progr@@ am, I was able to take part in the Na@@ tional You@@ th Con@@ ven@@ tion in P@@ h@@ il@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ i@@ a.    
 My particular grou@@ p@@ 's foc@@ us was on you@@ th viol@@ ence, and having been the vic@@ ti@@ m of bul@@ l@@ ying for most of my life, this was a subjec@@ t in which I felt particularly pas@@ sion@@ ate.    
 The memb@@ ers of our group came from many different wal@@ ks of life.    
 One day tow@@ ard the end of the con@@ ven@@ tion, I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ friend@@ ed was J@@ e@@ wi@@ sh@@ .    
 Now, it had taken several days for this deta@@ il to come to li@@ ght, and I realized that there was no natural anim@@ os@@ ity between the two of us.    
 I had never had a J@@ ew@@ ish friend before@@ , and f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to over@@ come a bar@@ ri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was in@@ sur@@ moun@@ tab@@ le.    
 A@@ no@@ ther maj@@ or tur@@ ning point came when I found a sum@@ m@@ er job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ar@@ den@@ s, an am@@ us@@ ement par@@ k.    
 Th@@ er@@ e, I was ex@@ pos@@ ed to people from all sorts of fa@@ i@@ th@@ s and cul@@ tures, and that experience pro@@ ved to be fundamental to the development of my charac@@ ter.    
 M@@ ost of my life, I'd been taught that hom@@ o@@ sex@@ u@@ ality was a sin@@ , and by ex@@ ten@@ sion, that all ga@@ y people were a nega@@ tive in@@ flu@@ ence.    
 As chance would have it, I had the opportunity to work with some of the ga@@ y perfor@@ m@@ ers at a show there, and soon found that many were the kin@@ des@@ t, least judg@@ mental people I had ever me@@ t.    
 Be@@ ing bul@@ li@@ ed as a kid created a sense of emp@@ a@@ th@@ y in me tow@@ ard the suffer@@ ing of other@@ s, and it comes very un@@ n@@ atur@@ ally to me to tre@@ at people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be tre@@ ated.    
 Because of that feel@@ ing, I was able to con@@ tr@@ ast the ster@@ e@@ o@@ types I'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interac@@ tion.    
 I don't know what it's like to be ga@@ y, but I'm well ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with being judg@@ ed for something that's beyond my contro@@ l@@ .    
 Then there was "The D@@ a@@ ily Sh@@ ow@@ ."    
 On a ni@@ ght@@ ly bas@@ is, J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t forced me to be in@@ tel@@ lec@@ tu@@ ally hon@@ est with myself about my own bi@@ go@@ try and helped me to realize that a person@@ 's rac@@ e, reli@@ gi@@ on or sex@@ u@@ al ori@@ ent@@ ation had nothing to do with the qu@@ ality of one's charac@@ ter.    
 He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in des@@ per@@ ate need of one.    
 In@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion can often come from an u@@ nex@@ pec@@ ted plac@@ e, and the fact that a J@@ ew@@ ish com@@ edi@@ an had done more to posi@@ tively in@@ flu@@ ence my world@@ view than my own ex@@ tre@@ mis@@ t father is not lo@@ st on me.    
 One day, I had a conversation with my mother about how my world@@ view was starting to chang@@ e, and she said something to me that I will hold de@@ ar to my heart for as long as I liv@@ e.    
 She looked at me with the we@@ ary ey@@ es of someone who had experienc@@ ed enough do@@ g@@ ma@@ tis@@ m to last a life@@ time, and said, "I'm ti@@ red of h@@ ating people@@ ."    
 In that instan@@ t, I realized how much nega@@ tive energy it takes to hold that h@@ at@@ red inside of you.    
 Z@@ a@@ k E@@ bra@@ him is not my real nam@@ e.    
 I changed it when my family decided to end our connec@@ tion with my father and start a new life.    
 So why would I out myself and pot@@ entially put myself in danger@@ ?    
 Well, that's simp@@ le.    
 I do it in the hop@@ es that perhaps someone some@@ day who is comp@@ ell@@ ed to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way, that al@@ though I had been subjec@@ ted to this viol@@ ent, in@@ t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant ide@@ o@@ log@@ y, that I did not become f@@ an@@ a@@ tici@@ z@@ ed.    
 Instea@@ d, I choose to use my experience to fi@@ ght back against ter@@ ror@@ ism, against the bi@@ go@@ tr@@ y.    
 I do it for the victim@@ s of ter@@ ror@@ ism and their loved on@@ es, for the terri@@ ble pa@@ in and lo@@ ss that ter@@ ror@@ ism has forced up@@ on their lives.    
 For the victim@@ s of ter@@ ror@@ ism, I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess ac@@ ts and con@@ de@@ m@@ n my father@@ 's ac@@ tions.    
 And with that simple fact, I stand here as pro@@ of that violence isn't in@@ her@@ ent in one's reli@@ gi@@ on or rac@@ e, and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father@@ .    
 I am not my father@@ .    
 Thank you. Thank you, every@@ bod@@ y. Thank you all. Th@@ an@@ ks a lo@@ t.     
 Ri@@ ght now you have a movie playing inside your hea@@ d.    
 It's an amazing multi@@ -@@ tr@@ ack movi@@ e.    
 It has 3@@ D vi@@ sion and sur@@ rou@@ nd sound for what you're seeing and hear@@ ing right now, but that's just the start of it.    
 Y@@ our movie has sm@@ ell and ta@@ ste and tou@@ ch.    
 It has a sense of your bod@@ y, pa@@ in, hun@@ g@@ er, org@@ as@@ m@@ s.    
 It has emo@@ tions, ang@@ er and happin@@ ess.    
 It has memor@@ ies, like scen@@ es from your child@@ hood playing before you.    
 And it has this con@@ st@@ ant voic@@ e@@ over nar@@ ra@@ tive in your st@@ ream of consci@@ ous thin@@ king.    
 At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this direc@@ t@@ ly.    
 This movie is your st@@ ream of consciousn@@ ess, the subjec@@ t of experience of the mind and the world.    
 Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is one of the fundamental fac@@ ts of human exist@@ ence.    
 E@@ ach of us is consci@@ ous.    
 We all have our own inner movi@@ e, you and you and you.    
 There's nothing we know about more direc@@ t@@ ly.    
 At lea@@ st, I know about my consciousness direc@@ t@@ ly.    
 I can't be certain that you guys are consci@@ ous.    
 Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness also is what makes life worth liv@@ ing.    
 If we weren't consci@@ ous, nothing in our lives would have mean@@ ing or valu@@ e.    
 But at the same time, it's the most myster@@ i@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on in the univer@@ se.    
 Why are we conscious@@ ?    
 Why do we have these inner movi@@ es?    
 Why aren't we just robo@@ ts who process all this in@@ pu@@ t, produce all that out@@ pu@@ t, without experiencing the inner movie at all@@ ?    
 Ri@@ ght now, no@@ body knows the answ@@ ers to those ques@@ tions.    
 I'm going to sugg@@ est that to inte@@ gr@@ ate consciousness into sci@@ ence, some radi@@ cal ideas may be ne@@ e@@ de@@ d.    
 Some people say a science of consciousness is impos@@ sib@@ le.    
 S@@ ci@@ ence, by its natu@@ re, is objec@@ tive.    
 Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness, by its natu@@ re, is subjec@@ tive.    
 So there can never be a science of consciousness.    
 For much of the 20@@ th centur@@ y, that view hel@@ d s@@ way.    
 P@@ sy@@ cho@@ logi@@ sts stu@@ died behavi@@ or objec@@ tiv@@ ely, neuro@@ scientists stu@@ died the brain objec@@ tiv@@ ely, and no@@ body even men@@ tion@@ ed consciousness.    
 E@@ ven 30 years ago, when TED got star@@ ted, there was very little scientific work on consciousness.    
 Now, about 20 years ago, all that began to change.    
 N@@ e@@ uro@@ scientists like Fran@@ c@@ is C@@ ri@@ ck and physic@@ ists like R@@ o@@ g@@ er P@@ en@@ ro@@ se said now is the time for science to att@@ ack consciousness.    
 And since then, there's been a real explo@@ sion, a flow@@ ering of scientific work on consciousness.    
 And this work has been wonder@@ ful. It's been great@@ .    
 But it also has some fundamental lim@@ it@@ ations so far@@ .    
 The cent@@ er@@ piece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the se@@ arch for cor@@ rela@@ tions, cor@@ rela@@ tions between certain are@@ as of the brain and certain st@@ ates of consciousness.    
 We saw some of this kind of work from N@@ anc@@ y K@@ an@@ wi@@ sh@@ er and the wonder@@ ful work she present@@ ed just a few minut@@ es ago.    
 Now we understand much bet@@ ter, for example, the kinds of brain are@@ as that go along with the consci@@ ous experience of seeing fac@@ es or of feeling pa@@ in or of feeling happ@@ y.    
 But this is still a science of cor@@ rela@@ tions.    
 It's not a science of ex@@ plan@@ a@@ tions.    
 We know that these brain are@@ as go along with certain kinds of consci@@ ous experienc@@ e, but we don't know why they do.    
 I like to put this by sa@@ ying that this kind of work from neuro@@ science is answ@@ ering some of the questions we want answ@@ ered about consciousn@@ ess, the questions about what certain brain are@@ as do and what they cor@@ rel@@ ate with@@ .    
 But in a certain sen@@ se, those are the easy problem@@ s.    
 No kno@@ ck on the neuro@@ scienti@@ st@@ s.    
 There are no truly easy problems with consciousness.    
 But it doesn't ad@@ dres@@ s the real myster@@ y at the cor@@ e of this subjec@@ t@@ : why is it that all that physical process@@ ing in a brain should be ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed by consciousness at all@@ ?    
 Why is there this inner subjec@@ tive movi@@ e?    
 Ri@@ ght now, we don't really have a be@@ ad on that.    
 let's just give neuro@@ science a few years.    
 I@@ t@@ 'll turn out to be another emerg@@ ent ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on like tra@@ ff@@ ic j@@ am@@ s, like h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ es, like life, and we@@ 'll figure it out.    
 The clas@@ sical ca@@ ses of emerg@@ ence are all ca@@ ses of emerg@@ ent behavi@@ or, how a tra@@ ff@@ ic j@@ am beha@@ ves, how a h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e fun@@ c@@ tions, how a living organ@@ ism re@@ produc@@ es and adap@@ ts and me@@ tab@@ o@@ li@@ z@@ es, all questions about objec@@ tive fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing.    
 You could app@@ ly that to the human brain in expla@@ ining some of the behavi@@ ors and the fun@@ c@@ tions of the human brain as emerg@@ ent ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a@@ : how we wal@@ k, how we tal@@ k, how we play ch@@ ess, all these questions about behavi@@ or.    
 But when it comes to consciousn@@ ess, questions about behavi@@ or are am@@ ong the easy problem@@ s.    
 When it comes to the hard proble@@ m, that's the question of why is it that all this behavi@@ or is ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed by subjec@@ tive experienc@@ e?    
 And here, the stand@@ ard par@@ a@@ dig@@ m even the stand@@ ard par@@ a@@ dig@@ ms of neuro@@ sci@@ ence, don't re@@ ally, so far@@ , have that much to sa@@ y.    
 Now, I'm a scientific materi@@ al@@ ist at hear@@ t.    
 I want a scientific theor@@ y of consciousness that work@@ s, and for a long time, I b@@ ang@@ ed my head against the w@@ all looking for a theor@@ y of consciousness in pu@@ rely physical terms that would work.    
 But I even@@ tu@@ ally came to the con@@ cl@@ usi@@ on that that just didn't work for sy@@ ste@@ ma@@ tic reas@@ on@@ s.    
 It's a long story, but the cor@@ e idea is just that what you get from pu@@ rely re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist ex@@ plan@@ ations in physical ter@@ ms, in bra@@ in@@ -@@ based ter@@ ms, is stories about the fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ing of a system@@ , its struc@@ ture, its dy@@ nam@@ ic@@ s, the behavi@@ or it produc@@ es, great for sol@@ ving the easy problems — how we beha@@ ve, how we fun@@ c@@ tion — but when it comes to subjec@@ tive experience — why does all this feel like something from the in@@ s@@ ide@@ ? —    
 that's something fundament@@ ally new@@ , and it's always a f@@ ur@@ ther ques@@ tion.    
 So I think we're at a kind of imp@@ as@@ se here.    
 We've got this wonder@@ ful, great cha@@ in of ex@@ plan@@ ation, we're used to it, where physic@@ s expla@@ ins chem@@ i@@ str@@ y, chem@@ i@@ str@@ y expla@@ ins bio@@ log@@ y, bio@@ logy expla@@ ins par@@ ts of psycho@@ log@@ y.    
 But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this pic@@ ture.    
 On the one han@@ d, it's a d@@ atu@@ m that we're consci@@ ous.    
 On the other han@@ d, we don't know how to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ate it into our scientific view of the world.    
 So I think consciousness right now is a kind of an@@ om@@ al@@ y, one that we need to inte@@ gr@@ ate into our view of the world, but we don't yet see h@@ ow@@ .    
 F@@ ac@@ ed with an an@@ om@@ al@@ y like this, radi@@ cal ideas may be ne@@ e@@ ded, and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initi@@ ally seem crazy before we can come to g@@ ri@@ ps with consciousness scienti@@ fic@@ ally.    
 Now, there are a few can@@ di@@ dat@@ es for what those crazy ideas might be.    
 My friend D@@ an D@@ en@@ net@@ t, who's here today, has one.    
 H@@ is crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.    
 The whole idea of the inner subjec@@ tive movie invol@@ ves a kind of ill@@ usi@@ on or conf@@ usi@@ on.    
 the objec@@ tive fun@@ c@@ tions, the behavi@@ ors of the bra@@ in, and then we've expla@@ ined everything that needs to be expla@@ in@@ ed.    
 Well I say, more power to him.    
 That's the kind of radi@@ cal idea that we need to explor@@ e if you want to have a pu@@ rely re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist At the same time, for me and for many other people, that view is a bit too close to simply den@@ ying the d@@ atu@@ m of consciousness to be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ y.    
 So I go in a different direc@@ tion.    
 In the time re@@ main@@ ing, I want to explor@@ e two crazy ideas that I think may have some prom@@ is@@ e.    
 The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundament@@ al.    
 P@@ hy@@ sic@@ ists sometimes take some as@@ pec@@ ts of the univer@@ se as fundamental building bloc@@ k@@ s: space and time and mas@@ s.    
 They po@@ st@@ ul@@ ate fundamental law@@ s go@@ ver@@ ning them, like the law@@ s of gra@@ v@@ ity or of quan@@ tu@@ m mechan@@ ic@@ s.    
 These fundamental proper@@ ties and law@@ s aren't expla@@ ined in terms of anything more bas@@ ic.    
 R@@ a@@ ther@@ , they're taken as pri@@ mi@@ tive, and you build up the world from there.    
 Now some@@ times, the li@@ st of fundament@@ als exp@@ an@@ ds.    
 In the 19@@ th centur@@ y, Ma@@ x@@ well figu@@ red out that you can't explain elec@@ tr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ a in terms of the exist@@ ing fundament@@ als — space, time, mas@@ s, N@@ ew@@ ton@@ 's law@@ s — so he po@@ st@@ ul@@ ated fundamental law@@ s of elec@@ tr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m and po@@ st@@ ul@@ ated elec@@ tri@@ c char@@ ge as a fundamental el@@ ement that those law@@ s govern@@ .    
 I think that's the situation we're in If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the exist@@ ing fundament@@ als — space, time, mas@@ s, char@@ ge — then as a matter of log@@ ic, you need to exp@@ and the li@@ st.    
 The natural thing to do is to po@@ st@@ ul@@ ate consciousness itself as something fundament@@ al, a fundamental building b@@ lo@@ ck of natu@@ re.    
 This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.    
 This op@@ en@@ s up the way for you to do science with it.    
 What we then need is to study the fundamental law@@ s go@@ ver@@ ning consciousn@@ ess, the law@@ s that con@@ ne@@ ct consciousness to other fundament@@ al@@ s: space, time, mas@@ s, physical process@@ es.    
 P@@ hy@@ sic@@ ists sometimes say that we want fundamental law@@ s so simple that we could write them on the front of a t@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t.    
 Well I think something like that is the situation we're in with consciousness.    
 We want to find fundamental law@@ s so simple we could write them on the front of a t@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t.    
 We don't know what those law@@ s are ye@@ t, but that's what we're af@@ ter.    
 The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be uni@@ vers@@ al.    
 Every system might have some degre@@ e of consciousness.    
 This view is sometimes called pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ is@@ m@@ : p@@ an for all, psy@@ ch for min@@ d, every system is consci@@ ous, not just human@@ s, do@@ g@@ s, mic@@ e, f@@ li@@ es, but even R@@ o@@ b K@@ ni@@ gh@@ t's micro@@ b@@ es, el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary partic@@ les.    
 E@@ ven a pho@@ t@@ on has some degre@@ e of consciousness.    
 The idea is not that pho@@ tons are intellig@@ ent or thin@@ king.    
 It's not that a pho@@ t@@ on is wr@@ ac@@ ked with ang@@ st because it's thinking, "A@@ w@@ w@@ , I'm always bu@@ z@@ zing around near the spe@@ ed of li@@ ght.    
 I never get to s@@ low down and sm@@ ell the ro@@ ses@@ ."    
 No, not like that.    
 But the thought is maybe pho@@ tons might have some el@@ ement of ra@@ w@@ , subjec@@ tive feel@@ ing, some pri@@ mi@@ tive p@@ rec@@ ur@@ s@@ or to consciousness.    
 This may sound a bit k@@ oo@@ k@@ y to you.    
 I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing@@ ?    
 Some motiv@@ ation comes from the first crazy idea@@ , that consciousness is fundament@@ al.    
 If it's fundament@@ al, like space and time and mas@@ s, it's natural to supp@@ ose that it might be uni@@ vers@@ al to@@ o, the way they are.    
 It's also worth no@@ ting that al@@ though the idea seems coun@@ ter@@ intui@@ tive to us, it's much less coun@@ ter@@ intui@@ tive to people from different cul@@ tures, where the human mind is seen as much more contin@@ u@@ ous with natu@@ re.    
 A deep@@ er motiv@@ ation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental law@@ s connec@@ ting consciousness is to lin@@ k consciousness to information.    
 Wh@@ er@@ ever there's information process@@ ing, there's consciousness.    
 C@@ om@@ ple@@ x information process@@ ing, like in a human@@ , complex consciousness.    
 S@@ imp@@ le information process@@ ing, simple consciousness.    
 A really exc@@ iting thing is in recent years a neuro@@ scienti@@ st, G@@ i@@ u@@ li@@ o T@@ on@@ on@@ i@@ , has taken this kind of theor@@ y and develop@@ ed it ri@@ g@@ or@@ ously with a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical theor@@ y.    
 He has a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical measure of information inte@@ gra@@ tion which he call@@ s ph@@ i@@ , meas@@ ur@@ ing the amount of information And he supp@@ os@@ es that ph@@ i goes along with consciousness.    
 So in a human bra@@ in, incredi@@ b@@ ly large amount of information inte@@ gra@@ tion, high degre@@ e of ph@@ i@@ , a whole lot of consciousness.    
 In a m@@ ous@@ e, medi@@ um degre@@ e of information inte@@ gra@@ tion, still pretty signific@@ ant, pretty seri@@ ous amount of consciousness.    
 But as you go down to wor@@ ms, micro@@ b@@ es, partic@@ l@@ es, the amount of ph@@ i f@@ all@@ s off.    
 The amount of information inte@@ gra@@ tion f@@ all@@ s off@@ , but it's still n@@ on-@@ zer@@ o.    
 On T@@ on@@ on@@ i@@ 's theor@@ y, there's still going to be a n@@ on-@@ zer@@ o degre@@ e of consciousness.    
 In effec@@ t, he's pro@@ pos@@ ing a fundamental la@@ w of consciousn@@ ess@@ : high ph@@ i@@ , high consciousness.    
 Now, I don't know if this theor@@ y is right, in the science of consciousn@@ ess, and it's been used to inte@@ gr@@ ate a whole ran@@ ge of scientific dat@@ a, and it does have a n@@ ice proper@@ ty that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t.    
 A@@ no@@ ther fin@@ al motiv@@ ation is that pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ ism might help us to inte@@ gr@@ ate consciousness into the physical world.    
 P@@ hy@@ sic@@ ists and ph@@ i@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ ers have often ob@@ ser@@ ved that physic@@ s is curi@@ ously ab@@ str@@ ac@@ t. It descri@@ b@@ es the struc@@ ture of reality using a bunch of equ@@ a@@ tions, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that under@@ li@@ es it.    
 As Ste@@ ph@@ en H@@ aw@@ king pu@@ ts it, what pu@@ ts the fire into the equ@@ a@@ tion@@ s?    
 Well, on the pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ ist view@@ , you can leave the equ@@ ations of physic@@ s as they are, but you can take them to be descri@@ bing the flu@@ x of consciousness.    
 That's what physic@@ s really is ultim@@ ately do@@ ing, descri@@ bing the flu@@ x of consciousness.    
 On this view@@ , it's consciousness that pu@@ ts the fire into the equ@@ a@@ tions.    
 On that view@@ , consciousness doesn't dang@@ le outside the physical world as some kind of extra@@ .    
 It's there right at its hear@@ t.    
 This view@@ , I think, the pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ ist view@@ , has the potential to trans@@ figure our relationship to natu@@ re, and it may have some pretty seri@@ ous social and e@@ thi@@ cal consequ@@ enc@@ es.    
 Some of these may be coun@@ ter@@ intui@@ tive.    
 I used to think I sh@@ ouldn't e@@ at anything which is consci@@ ous, so ther@@ e@@ fore I should be ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ari@@ an.    
 Now, if you're a pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ ist and you take that view@@ , you're going to go very hun@@ gr@@ y.    
 So I think when you think about it, this t@@ ends to trans@@ figure your view@@ s, wher@@ e@@ as what mat@@ ters for e@@ thi@@ cal pur@@ pos@@ es and mor@@ al consid@@ er@@ a@@ tions, not so much the fact of consciousn@@ ess, but the degre@@ e and the comple@@ x@@ ity of consciousness.    
 It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other system@@ s, like compu@@ ters.    
 What about the arti@@ fic@@ i@@ ally intellig@@ ent system in the movie "H@@ er@@ ," S@@ am@@ an@@ th@@ a@@ ?    
 Is she conscious@@ ?    
 Well, if you take the informa@@ tion@@ al, pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ ist view@@ , she certainly has complicated information process@@ ing and inte@@ gra@@ tion, so the answer is very likely y@@ es, she is consci@@ ous.    
 If that's right, it rais@@ es pretty seri@@ ous e@@ thi@@ cal issu@@ es about both the eth@@ ics of develop@@ ing intellig@@ ent computer systems and the eth@@ ics of tur@@ ning them off.    
 F@@ in@@ ally, you might ask about the consciousness of whole grou@@ ps, the planet.    
 Do@@ es C@@ an@@ ad@@ a have its own consciousn@@ ess@@ ?    
 Or at a more local level@@ , does an inte@@ gr@@ ated group like the audi@@ ence at a TED conf@@ er@@ ence, are we right now having a collec@@ tive TED consciousn@@ ess, an inner movie for this collec@@ tive TED group which is dist@@ in@@ ct from the inner movi@@ es of each of our part@@ s?    
 I don't know the answer to that ques@@ tion, but I think it's at least one worth taking seri@@ ous@@ ly.    
 Oka@@ y, so this pan@@ psy@@ ch@@ ist vi@@ sion, it is a radi@@ cal one, and I don't know that it's cor@@ rec@@ t.    
 I'm actually more conf@@ id@@ ent about the first crazy idea@@ , that consciousness is fundament@@ al, than about the second one, that it's uni@@ vers@@ al.    
 I mean, the view rais@@ es any number of ques@@ tions, has any number of challeng@@ es, like how do those little b@@ its of consciousness ad@@ d up to the kind of complex consciousness If we can answer those ques@@ tions, then I think we're going to be well on our way to a seri@@ ous theor@@ y of consciousness.    
 If not, well, this is the har@@ d@@ est problem perhaps in science and ph@@ i@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ h@@ y.    
 We can't ex@@ pect to solve it over@@ ni@@ ght.    
 But I do think we're going to figure it out even@@ tu@@ ally.    
 Un@@ der@@ standing consciousness is a real ke@@ y, I think, both to understanding the univer@@ se and to understanding our@@ selves.    
 It may just take the right crazy idea@@ .    
 Thank you.    
 I grew up in a very small country town I had a very normal@@ , low@@ -@@ key kind of up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing.    
 I went to school, I hun@@ g out with my friends, I f@@ ought with my youn@@ g@@ er si@@ ster@@ s.    
 It was all very normal@@ .    
 And when I was 1@@ 5@@ , a memb@@ er of my local community approach@@ ed my parents and wanted to n@@ om@@ in@@ ate me for a community achiev@@ ement a@@ war@@ d.    
 And my parents said, "H@@ m, that's really n@@ ic@@ e, but there's kind of one g@@ lar@@ ing problem with that.    
 She ha@@ s@@ n't actually achiev@@ ed any@@ thing@@ ." And they were right, you know.    
 I went to school, I got good mar@@ ks, I had a very low@@ -@@ key after school job in my mu@@ m@@ 's ha@@ ir@@ dres@@ sing sal@@ on, and I spent a lot of time watching "@@ Bu@@ ff@@ y the V@@ am@@ pi@@ re S@@ lay@@ er@@ " and "D@@ aw@@ son@@ 's C@@ ree@@ k@@ ."    
 Yea@@ h, I know. What a con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tion.    
 But they were right, you know.    
 I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all.    
 I wasn't doing anything that could be consid@@ ered an achiev@@ ement if you took dis@@ ability out of the equ@@ ation.    
 Y@@ ear@@ s later, I was on my second teach@@ ing rou@@ nd in a M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ ne high school, and I was about 20 minut@@ es into a year 1@@ 1 leg@@ al stu@@ dies class when this boy put up his hand and said, "H@@ ey mis@@ s, when are you going to start doing your spe@@ e@@ ch@@ ?"    
 And I said, "What spe@@ e@@ ch@@ ?"    
 You know, I'd been talking them about de@@ fa@@ ma@@ tion la@@ w for a good 20 minut@@ es.    
 And he said, "@@ You know, like, your motiv@@ a@@ tional spea@@ king.    
 You know, when people in whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir@@ s come to school, they usually say, like, inspi@@ ra@@ tional stuff@@ ?"    
   "@@ It's usually in the big h@@ all@@ ."    
 And that's when it da@@ w@@ ned on me@@ : This kid had only ever experienc@@ ed disabled people as objec@@ ts of inspi@@ ra@@ tion.    
 We are not, to this kid -- and it's not his fa@@ ul@@ t, I mean, that's tru@@ e for many of us.    
 For lots of us, disabled people are not our teach@@ ers or our doc@@ tors or our man@@ ic@@ u@@ ri@@ st@@ s.    
 We're not real people. We are there to inspi@@ re.    
 And in fact, I am sitting on this st@@ age looking like I do in this whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir@@ , and you are probably kind of expec@@ ting me to inspi@@ re you. Ri@@ ght? Yea@@ h.    
 Well, la@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ m@@ en, I'm afraid I'm going to disap@@ point you drama@@ tic@@ ally.    
 I am not here to inspi@@ re you.    
 I am here to tell you that we have been li@@ ed to about disab@@ ility.    
 Yea@@ h, we've been so@@ ld the li@@ e that dis@@ ability is a B@@ ad Th@@ ing, cap@@ ital B@@ , cap@@ ital T@@ .    
 It's a bad thing, and to live with a dis@@ ability makes you excep@@ tion@@ al.    
 It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you excep@@ tion@@ al.    
 And in the past few years, we've been able to pro@@ p@@ ag@@ ate this li@@ e even f@@ ur@@ ther vi@@ a social medi@@ a.    
 You may have seen images like this one@@ : "The only dis@@ ability in life is a bad at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de@@ ."    
 Or this one@@ : "@@ Y@@ our exc@@ use is inv@@ al@@ id@@ ." In@@ de@@ ed.    
 Or this one@@ : "@@ Be@@ fore you qu@@ it, tr@@ y@@ !@@ "    
 These are just a couple of exam@@ pl@@ es, but there are a lot of these images out there.    
 You know, you might have seen the one, the little girl with no hands dra@@ w@@ ing a picture with a pen@@ ci@@ l hel@@ d in her m@@ ou@@ th.    
 You might have seen a child run@@ ning on car@@ b@@ on fi@@ b@@ er pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic leg@@ s.    
 And these imag@@ es, there are lots of them out there, they are what we call inspi@@ ra@@ tion por@@ n.    
   And I use the term por@@ n deli@@ ber@@ ately, because they objec@@ ti@@ fy one group of people for the bene@@ fit of another group of people.    
 So in this case, we're objec@@ ti@@ f@@ ying disabled people for the bene@@ fit of n@@ on@@ disabled people.    
 The pur@@ p@@ ose of these images is to inspi@@ re you, to motiv@@ ate you, so that we can look at them and think, "Well, ho@@ we@@ ver bad my life is, it could be wor@@ se.    
 I could be that person@@ ."    
 But what if you are that person@@ ?    
 been approach@@ ed by strang@@ ers wan@@ ting to tell me that they think I'm bra@@ ve or inspi@@ ra@@ tion@@ al, and this was long before my work had any kind of public pro@@ fi@@ le.    
 They were just kind of con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating me for manag@@ ing to get up in the mor@@ ning and remember my own nam@@ e. And it is objec@@ ti@@ f@@ y@@ ing.    
 These imag@@ es, those images objec@@ ti@@ fy disabled people for the bene@@ fit of n@@ on@@ disabled people.    
 They are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren't so bad for you, to put your wor@@ ri@@ es into perspec@@ tive.    
 And life as a disabled person is actually some@@ what diffic@@ ul@@ t.    
 We do over@@ come some things.    
 But the things that we're over@@ coming are not the things that you think they are.    
 They are not things to do with our bo@@ di@@ es.    
 I use the term "@@ disabled people@@ " quite deli@@ ber@@ ately, because I sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ be to what's called the social model of disab@@ il@@ ity, which tel@@ ls us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our di@@ ag@@ no@@ s@@ es.    
 So I have li@@ ved in this body a long time.    
 I'm quite f@@ ond of it.    
 It does the things that I need it to do, and I've learned to use it to the best of its cap@@ ac@@ ity just as you ha@@ ve, and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.    
 They're not doing anything out of the ordin@@ ary.    
 They are just using their bodies to the best of their cap@@ ac@@ ity.    
 So is it really fa@@ ir to objec@@ ti@@ fy them in the way that we do, to share those imag@@ es?    
 Peop@@ le, when they say, "@@ You're an inspi@@ ra@@ tion@@ ," they mean it as a comp@@ li@@ ment.    
 And I know why it happen@@ s.    
 It's because of the li@@ e, it's because we've been so@@ ld this li@@ e that dis@@ ability makes you excep@@ tion@@ al.    
 And it hon@@ es@@ tly does@@ n'@@ t.    
 And I know what you're thin@@ king.    
 You know, I'm up here b@@ ag@@ g@@ ing out inspi@@ ra@@ tion, and you're thinking, "@@ J@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ , S@@ tel@@ la@@ , aren't you inspi@@ red sometimes by some thing@@ s@@ ?"    
 And the thing is, I am.    
 I learn from other disabled people all the time.    
 I'm learning not that I am luck@@ i@@ er than them, thou@@ gh@@ .    
 I am learning that it's a gen@@ i@@ us idea to use a pa@@ ir of bar@@ be@@ cu@@ e t@@ ong@@ s to pick up things that you dro@@ p@@ pe@@ d. I'm learning that ni@@ f@@ ty tri@@ ck where you can char@@ ge your mobile phone bat@@ ter@@ y from your cha@@ ir bat@@ ter@@ y.    
 G@@ en@@ i@@ us.    
 We are learning from each other@@ s' st@@ ren@@ g@@ th and end@@ ur@@ anc@@ e, not against our bodies and our di@@ ag@@ no@@ s@@ es, but against a world that excep@@ tion@@ al@@ iz@@ es and objec@@ ti@@ fi@@ es us.    
 I really think that this li@@ e that we've been so@@ ld about dis@@ ability is the greatest in@@ jus@@ tic@@ e.    
 It makes life hard for us.    
 And that qu@@ o@@ t@@ e, "The only dis@@ ability in life is a bad at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de@@ ," the reason that that's bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it is because it's just not tru@@ e, because of the social model of disab@@ ility.    
 No amount of sm@@ il@@ ing at a f@@ light of sta@@ ir@@ s has ever made it turn into a r@@ am@@ p.    
 N@@ ever@@ . S@@ mil@@ ing at a tel@@ e@@ vi@@ sion scre@@ en isn't going to make clo@@ sed cap@@ tions appe@@ ar for people who are de@@ af@@ .    
 No amount of standing in the middle of a boo@@ k@@ sho@@ p and radi@@ ating a posi@@ tive at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de is going to turn all those books into bra@@ il@@ le.    
 It's just not going to happen@@ .    
 I really want to live in a world where dis@@ ability is not the excep@@ tion, but the nor@@ m.    
 I want to live in a world where a 1@@ 5@@ -year-old girl sitting in her be@@ dro@@ om watching "@@ Bu@@ ff@@ y the V@@ am@@ pi@@ re S@@ lay@@ er@@ " isn't ref@@ er@@ red to as achiev@@ ing anything because she's doing it sitting dow@@ n.    
 I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expec@@ ta@@ tions of disabled people that we are con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ated for getting out of bed and remembering our own nam@@ es in the mor@@ n@@ ing.    
 I want to live in a world where we value gen@@ u@@ ine achiev@@ ement for disabled people, and I want to live in a world where a kid in year 1@@ 1 in a M@@ el@@ b@@ our@@ ne high school that his new te@@ ac@@ her is a whe@@ el@@ cha@@ ir us@@ er.    
 D@@ is@@ ability doesn't make you excep@@ tion@@ al, but ques@@ tion@@ ing what you think you know about it do@@ es.    
 Thank you.    
 What do augmented reality and prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al foo@@ t@@ b@@ all have to do with emp@@ a@@ th@@ y?    
 And what is the air spe@@ ed vel@@ oc@@ ity of an un@@ la@@ d@@ en s@@ wal@@ low@@ ?    
 Now un@@ fortun@@ ately, I'm only going to answer one of those questions today, so ple@@ as@@ e, try and con@@ tain your disap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment.    
 When most people think about augmented real@@ ity, they think about "@@ M@@ in@@ or@@ ity R@@ ep@@ ort@@ " and T@@ om C@@ ru@@ ise wa@@ ving his hands in the air@@ , but augmented reality is not science fic@@ tion.    
 A@@ u@@ gmented reality is something that will happen in our life@@ time, and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen@@ , and people need to be aw@@ are of that, because augmented reality will change our lives just as much as the Inter@@ net and the cell ph@@ one.    
 Now how do we get to augmented real@@ it@@ y?    
 Ste@@ p one is the step I'm we@@ aring right now, Goog@@ le G@@ las@@ s.    
 I'm sure many of you are famili@@ ar with Goog@@ le G@@ las@@ s.    
 What you may not be famili@@ ar with is that Goog@@ le G@@ las@@ s is a de@@ vice that will allow you to see what I se@@ e.    
 It will allow you to experience what it is like to be a prof@@ es@@ sion@@ al a@@ th@@ le@@ te on the fiel@@ d.    
 Ri@@ ght now, the only way you can be on the fiel@@ d is for me to try and descri@@ be it to you.    
 I have to use wor@@ ds.    
 I have to create a f@@ r@@ am@@ e@@ work that you then f@@ ill in with your imagin@@ ation.    
 With Goog@@ le G@@ las@@ s, we can put that under@@ ne@@ ath a hel@@ me@@ t, to be run@@ ning down the fiel@@ d at 100 miles an hour@@ , your blood p@@ oun@@ ding in your ear@@ s.    
 You can get a sense of what it's like to have a 2@@ 5@@ 0@@ -@@ p@@ ound man sp@@ rin@@ ting at you trying to de@@ cap@@ it@@ ate you with every oun@@ ce of his be@@ ing.    
 And I've been on the recei@@ ving end of that, and it doesn't feel very goo@@ d.    
 Now, I have some foo@@ ta@@ ge to show you of what it's like to wear Goog@@ le G@@ las@@ s under@@ ne@@ ath the hel@@ met to give you a ta@@ ste of that.    
 Un@@ fortun@@ ately, it's not N@@ F@@ L prac@@ tice foo@@ ta@@ ge because the N@@ F@@ L thin@@ ks emerg@@ ent technology is what happens when a sub@@ mar@@ ine sur@@ fac@@ es, but — — we do what we can@@ .    
 So let's pul@@ l up some vide@@ o.    
  Ch@@ r@@ is K@@ lu@@ we@@ : Go@@ .    
 U@@ gh, getting t@@ ack@@ led su@@ c@@ ks.    
 H@@ old on, let's get a little clo@@ s@@ er.    
 All right, read@@ y?    
 Go@@ !    
 Ch@@ r@@ is K@@ lu@@ we@@ : So as you can see, small ta@@ ste of what it's like to get t@@ ack@@ led on the foo@@ t@@ b@@ all fiel@@ d from the perspec@@ tive of the t@@ ack@@ le@@ e.    
 Now, you may have no@@ tic@@ ed there are the rest of the te@@ am.    
 We have some video of that cour@@ tes@@ y of the U@@ ni@@ versity of W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on.    
  Q@@ u@@ ar@@ ter@@ back@@ : H@@ e@@ y, M@@ ice 5@@ 4@@ ! M@@ ice 5@@ 4@@ !    
 B@@ l@@ ue 8@@ ! B@@ l@@ ue 8@@ ! Go@@ !    
 O@@ h@@ !    
 C@@ K@@ : So again, this takes you a little bit clo@@ s@@ er to what it's like to be on that fiel@@ d, but this is no@@ where what it's like to be on the N@@ F@@ L@@ .    
 F@@ ans want that experienc@@ e.    
 F@@ ans want to be on that fiel@@ d.    
 They want to be their favorite play@@ ers, and they@@ 've already talked to me on You@@ T@@ u@@ be, they@@ 've talked to me on T@@ wit@@ ter, say@@ ing, "H@@ e@@ y, can you get this on a quar@@ ter@@ back@@ ?    
 Can you get this on a run@@ ning back@@ ?    
 We want that experienc@@ e."    
 Well, once we have that experience with Go@@ P@@ r@@ o and Goog@@ le G@@ las@@ s, how do we make it more im@@ mer@@ si@@ ve@@ ?    
 How do we take that next st@@ ep@@ ?    
 Well, we take that step by going to something called the O@@ cul@@ us Ri@@ f@@ t, which I'm sure many of you are also famili@@ ar with@@ .    
 The O@@ cul@@ us Ri@@ ft has been descri@@ bed as one of the most real@@ istic virtu@@ al reality de@@ vic@@ es ever cre@@ ated, and that is not emp@@ ty h@@ yp@@ e.    
 I'm going to show you why that is not emp@@ ty hy@@ pe with this vide@@ o.    
  Man@@ : O@@ h@@ ! O@@ h@@ !    
 No@@ ! No@@ ! No@@ ! I don't want to play any@@ mo@@ re@@ ! No@@ !    
 O@@ h my Go@@ d@@ ! A@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ h@@ !    
 C@@ K@@ : So that is the experience of a man in fe@@ ar of his life.    
 of an A@@ dri@@ an Pe@@ ter@@ son bur@@ sting through the lin@@ e, sh@@ ed@@ ding a t@@ ack@@ l@@ er with a sti@@ ff@@ -@@ ar@@ m before sp@@ rin@@ ting in for a tou@@ ch@@ down@@ ?    
 What do you think that f@@ an@@ 's experience is going to be when he's M@@ ess@@ i sp@@ rin@@ ting down the p@@ it@@ ch putting the b@@ all in the back of the ne@@ t, or F@@ ed@@ er@@ er ser@@ ving in Wi@@ mb@@ le@@ don@@ ?    
 What do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a moun@@ tain at over 7@@ 0 miles an hour as an O@@ ly@@ mp@@ ic down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i@@ er@@ ?    
 I think ad@@ ult di@@ ap@@ er sal@@ es may surg@@ e.    
   But this is not yet augmented real@@ ity.    
 This is only virtu@@ al real@@ ity, V@@ .@@ R@@ .    
 How do we get to augmented real@@ ity, A@@ .@@ R@@ .@@ ?    
 We get to augmented reality when co@@ ach@@ es and manag@@ ers and ow@@ n@@ ers look at this information stre@@ am@@ ing in that people want to see, and they say, "@@ How do we use this to make our te@@ ams bet@@ ter@@ ?    
 How do we use this to win gam@@ es@@ ?"    
 Because te@@ ams always use technology to win gam@@ es.    
 They like win@@ n@@ ing. It makes them mone@@ y.    
 So a bri@@ ef history of technology in the N@@ F@@ L@@ .    
 In 19@@ 6@@ 5@@ , the B@@ al@@ ti@@ more C@@ ol@@ ts put a w@@ ri@@ st@@ b@@ and on their quar@@ ter@@ back to allow him to call pla@@ ys quick@@ er.    
 They ended up win@@ ning a S@@ up@@ er B@@ ow@@ l that year.    
 O@@ ther te@@ ams follow@@ ed su@@ it.    
 M@@ or@@ e people wat@@ ched the game because it was more exc@@ it@@ ing.    
 It was fa@@ st@@ er.    
 In 19@@ 9@@ 4@@ , the N@@ F@@ L put hel@@ met radi@@ os into the hel@@ me@@ ts of the quar@@ ter@@ bac@@ ks, and later the def@@ en@@ se.    
 M@@ or@@ e people wat@@ ched games because it was fa@@ st@@ er.    
 It was more enter@@ tain@@ ing.    
 In 20@@ 2@@ 3@@ , imagine you're a play@@ er walking back to the hu@@ dd@@ le, and you have your next play disp@@ la@@ yed right in front of your face on your cle@@ ar pl@@ as@@ tic vis@@ or that you already wear right now.    
 No more having to wor@@ ry about for@@ getting play@@ s.    
 No more wor@@ r@@ ying about having to memor@@ ize your play@@ boo@@ k.    
 You just go out and reac@@ t.    
 And co@@ ach@@ es really want this, because mis@@ sed assig@@ n@@ ments lo@@ se you gam@@ es, and co@@ ach@@ es h@@ ate lo@@ sing gam@@ es.    
 L@@ os@@ ing games gets you fi@@ red as a co@@ ach@@ .    
 They don't want that.    
 But augmented reality is not just an en@@ han@@ c@@ ed play@@ boo@@ k.    
 A@@ u@@ gmented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to en@@ han@@ ce how you play the game.    
 What would that be like@@ ?    
 Well, a very simple se@@ tu@@ p would be a camera on each cor@@ ner of the sta@@ di@@ um looking dow@@ n, giving you a bir@@ d@@ '@@ s@@ -@@ ey@@ e view of all the people down there.    
 You also have information from hel@@ met sen@@ sor@@ s and acc@@ el@@ er@@ ome@@ ters, technology that's being worked on right now.    
 You take all that informa@@ tion, and you st@@ ream it to your play@@ ers.    
 The good te@@ ams st@@ ream it in a way that the play@@ ers can us@@ e.    
 The bad ones have information over@@ lo@@ a@@ d.    
 That de@@ ter@@ min@@ es good te@@ ams from ba@@ d.    
 And now, your I@@ .@@ T@@ . de@@ partment is just as important as your s@@ cou@@ ting de@@ part@@ ment, and dat@@ a@@ -@@ min@@ ing is not for ner@@ ds any@@ more.    
 It's also for j@@ oc@@ ks. Who k@@ new@@ ?    
 What would that look like on the fiel@@ d?    
 Well, imagine you're the quar@@ ter@@ back.    
 You take the s@@ na@@ p and you dro@@ p back.    
 You're s@@ can@@ ning down@@ fiel@@ d for an open recei@@ ver.    
 All of a sudd@@ en, a b@@ right fl@@ as@@ h on the left side of your vis@@ or le@@ ts you know, bl@@ ind side lin@@ e@@ back@@ er is b@@ lit@@ zing in.    
 Nor@@ m@@ ally, you wouldn't be able to see him, but the augmented reality system le@@ ts you know.    
 You step up into the po@@ c@@ ke@@ t.    
 A@@ no@@ ther fl@@ as@@ h al@@ er@@ ts you to an open recei@@ ver.    
 You th@@ row the b@@ all, but you're hit right as you th@@ row@@ .    
 The b@@ all comes off trac@@ k.    
 You don't know where it's going to lan@@ d.    
 H@@ o@@ we@@ ver, on the recei@@ ver@@ 's vis@@ or, he se@@ es a pat@@ ch of gr@@ as@@ s light up, and he knows to read@@ ju@@ st.    
 He go@@ es, cat@@ ch@@ es the b@@ all, sp@@ rin@@ ts in, tou@@ ch@@ dow@@ n.    
 C@@ row@@ d goes w@@ il@@ d, and the f@@ ans are with him every step of the way, watching from every perspec@@ tive.    
 Now this is something that will create mas@@ sive exc@@ it@@ ement in the game.    
 It will make tons of people wat@@ ch, because people want this experienc@@ e.    
 F@@ ans want to be on the fiel@@ d.    
 They want to be their favorite play@@ er.    
 A@@ u@@ gmented reality will be a part of sp@@ ort@@ s, because it's too prof@@ it@@ able not to.    
 But the question I ask you is, is that's all that we're cont@@ ent to use augmented reality for@@ ?    
 Are we going to use it sol@@ ely for our pan@@ em@@ , our cir@@ cen@@ s@@ es, our enter@@ tain@@ ment as normal@@ ?    
 Because I believe that we can use augmented reality for something more.    
 I believe we can use augmented reality as a way to f@@ o@@ ster more emp@@ a@@ th@@ y within the human species it@@ self, by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mi@@ le in another person@@ 's sho@@ es.    
 We know what this technology is worth to sp@@ or@@ ts le@@ ag@@ u@@ es.    
 It's worth re@@ ven@@ u@@ e, to the tu@@ ne of billi@@ ons of dollars a year.    
 But what is this technology worth to a te@@ ac@@ her in a clas@@ s@@ room trying to show a bul@@ ly just how har@@ m@@ ful his ac@@ tions are from the perspec@@ tive of the victim@@ ?    
 What is this technology worth to a ga@@ y U@@ g@@ an@@ d@@ an or R@@ us@@ si@@ an trying to show the world what it's like living under per@@ se@@ cu@@ tion@@ ?    
 What is this technology worth to a C@@ om@@ man@@ der H@@ ad@@ fiel@@ d or a N@@ ei@@ l de@@ G@@ r@@ as@@ se T@@ y@@ son trying to inspi@@ re a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quar@@ ter@@ ly repor@@ ts and K@@ ar@@ d@@ as@@ hi@@ ans@@ ?    
 L@@ a@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ m@@ en, augmented reality is com@@ ing.    
 The questions we as@@ k, the choices we ma@@ ke, and the challeng@@ es we face are, as al@@ wa@@ ys, up to us.    
 Thank you.    
 I rec@@ ently re@@ ti@@ red from the Californi@@ a H@@ i@@ gh@@ way P@@ at@@ ro@@ l after 2@@ 3 years of servic@@ e.    
 The maj@@ or@@ ity of those 2@@ 3 years was spent pat@@ ro@@ l@@ ling the sou@@ ther@@ n end of M@@ ar@@ in C@@ oun@@ ty, which inclu@@ des the G@@ old@@ en G@@ ate B@@ ri@@ dg@@ e.    
 The bridge is an ic@@ on@@ ic struc@@ ture, known world@@ w@@ ide for its beautiful view@@ s of S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co@@ , the P@@ ac@@ i@@ fic O@@ c@@ e@@ an, and its in@@ spir@@ ing architec@@ ture.    
 Un@@ fortun@@ ately, it is also a mag@@ net for suic@@ id@@ e, being one of the most u@@ ti@@ li@@ zed sit@@ es in the world.    
 The G@@ old@@ en G@@ ate B@@ ri@@ dge op@@ ened in 19@@ 3@@ 7@@ .    
 Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h S@@ tra@@ us@@ s, chi@@ ef engine@@ er in char@@ ge of building the bri@@ dg@@ e, was qu@@ o@@ ted as say@@ ing, "The bridge is prac@@ tically suic@@ ide@@ -@@ pro@@ of.    
 Su@@ ic@@ ide from the bridge is nei@@ ther prac@@ tical no@@ r prob@@ ab@@ le@@ ."    
 But since its op@@ en@@ ing, over 1@@ ,@@ 6@@ 00 people have le@@ ap@@ t to their death from that bri@@ dg@@ e.    
 Some believe that tra@@ vel@@ ing between the two tow@@ ers will le@@ ad you to another di@@ men@@ sion -- this bridge has been rom@@ an@@ tici@@ zed as such — that the f@@ all from that fre@@ es you from all your wor@@ ri@@ es and g@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ , and the wat@@ ers bel@@ ow will cle@@ an@@ se your sou@@ l@@ .    
 But let me tell you what actually oc@@ cur@@ s when the bridge is used as a means of suic@@ id@@ e.    
 Af@@ ter a free f@@ all of four to five secon@@ ds, the body stri@@ kes the water at about 7@@ 5 miles an hour@@ .    
 That impact sh@@ at@@ ters bon@@ es, some of which then p@@ un@@ c@@ ture v@@ ital organ@@ s.    
 M@@ ost di@@ e on imp@@ ac@@ t.    
 Th@@ ose that don't gener@@ ally fla@@ il in the water hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly, and then d@@ row@@ n.    
 I don't think that those who contemp@@ l@@ ate this me@@ th@@ od of suic@@ ide realize how g@@ ris@@ ly a death that they will fac@@ e.    
 This is the cor@@ d.    
 E@@ x@@ cep@@ t for around the two tow@@ ers, there is 3@@ 2 in@@ ch@@ es of ste@@ el par@@ all@@ el@@ ing the bri@@ dg@@ e.    
 This is where most fol@@ ks stand before taking their lives.    
 I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cor@@ d, and at their dar@@ k@@ est time, it is very difficult to bring them back.    
 I took this pho@@ to last year as this young woman spo@@ ke to an offic@@ er contemp@@ l@@ ating her life.    
 I want to tell you very happ@@ ily that we were success@@ ful that day in getting her back over the ra@@ il.    
 When I first began working on the bri@@ dg@@ e, we had no for@@ mal tra@@ in@@ ing.    
 You stru@@ gg@@ led to fun@@ ne@@ l your way through these call@@ s.    
 This was not only a dis@@ ser@@ vice to those contemp@@ l@@ ating suic@@ id@@ e, but to the offic@@ ers as well.    
 We've come a long@@ , long way since th@@ en.    
 Now, ve@@ ter@@ an offic@@ ers and psycho@@ logi@@ sts tra@@ in new offic@@ ers.    
 This is J@@ as@@ on G@@ ar@@ b@@ er.    
 I met J@@ as@@ on on J@@ u@@ ly 2@@ 2 of last year when I get recei@@ ved a call of a possible suic@@ id@@ al subjec@@ t sitting on the cor@@ d near m@@ id@@ sp@@ an.    
 I respon@@ ded, and when I arri@@ v@@ ed, I ob@@ ser@@ ved J@@ as@@ on spea@@ king to a G@@ old@@ en G@@ ate B@@ ri@@ dge offic@@ er.    
 J@@ as@@ on was just 3@@ 2 years old and had flow@@ n out here from New J@@ er@@ se@@ y.    
 As a matter of fact, he had flow@@ n out here on two other oc@@ ca@@ sions from New J@@ er@@ se@@ y to at@@ temp@@ t suic@@ ide on this bri@@ dg@@ e.    
 Af@@ ter about an hour of spea@@ king with J@@ as@@ on, he asked us if we knew the story of P@@ an@@ d@@ or@@ a@@ 's bo@@ x@@ .    
 R@@ ec@@ all@@ ing your G@@ ree@@ k my@@ tho@@ log@@ y, Z@@ e@@ us created P@@ an@@ d@@ or@@ a, and sent her down to Earth with a bo@@ x, and told her, "@@ N@@ ever@@ , ever open that bo@@ x@@ ."    
 Well one day, curi@@ os@@ ity got the better of P@@ an@@ d@@ or@@ a, and she did open the bo@@ x@@ .    
 O@@ ut f@@ le@@ w pla@@ gu@@ es, sor@@ row@@ s, and all sorts of ev@@ ils against man@@ .    
 The only good thing in the bo@@ x was hop@@ e.    
 J@@ as@@ on then asked us, "What happens when you open the bo@@ x and hope isn't ther@@ e@@ ?"    
 He pa@@ used a few mom@@ ents, le@@ an@@ ed to his right, and was g@@ one.    
 This kin@@ d, intellig@@ ent young man from New J@@ er@@ se@@ y had just comm@@ it@@ ted suic@@ id@@ e.    
 I spo@@ ke with J@@ as@@ on@@ 's parents that even@@ ing, and I supp@@ ose that, when I was spea@@ king with them, that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well, because that very next day, their family r@@ ab@@ b@@ i called to chec@@ k on me.    
 J@@ as@@ on@@ 's parents had asked him to do so@@ .    
 The col@@ lat@@ er@@ al da@@ mage of suic@@ ide affec@@ ts so many people.    
 I p@@ ose these questions to you@@ : What would you do if your family memb@@ er, friend or loved one was suic@@ id@@ al@@ ?    
 What would you sa@@ y?    
 W@@ ould you know what to sa@@ y?    
 In my experienc@@ e, it's not just the talking that you do, but the list@@ en@@ ing.    
 L@@ ist@@ en to under@@ stan@@ d.    
 D@@ on@@ 't argu@@ e, bl@@ am@@ e, or tell the person you know how they feel@@ , because you probably don@@ '@@ t.    
 By just being there, you may just be the tur@@ ning point that they ne@@ ed.    
 If you think someone is suic@@ id@@ al, don't be afraid to conf@@ ront them and ask the ques@@ tion.    
 One way of asking them the question is like this: "O@@ ther@@ s in si@@ mil@@ ar cir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces have thought about ending their life@@ ; have you had these thou@@ ght@@ s@@ ?"    
 Con@@ f@@ ron@@ ting the person head@@ -@@ on may just save their life and be the tur@@ ning point for them.    
 Some other sig@@ ns to look for@@ : hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness, believ@@ ing that things are terri@@ ble and never going to get bet@@ ter@@ ; hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness, believ@@ ing that there is nothing that you can do about it@@ ; recent social with@@ dra@@ wal@@ ; and a lo@@ ss of inter@@ est in life.    
 I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I recei@@ ved an e@@ ma@@ il from a la@@ dy that I'd like to read you her let@@ ter.    
 She lo@@ st her son on J@@ an@@ u@@ ary 1@@ 9 of this year, and she wrote this me this e@@ ma@@ il just a couple of days ago, and it's with her per@@ mis@@ sion and bl@@ ess@@ ing that I read this to you.    
 "H@@ i@@ , K@@ ev@@ in. I imagine you're at the TED Con@@ fer@@ ence.    
 That must be quite the experience to be there.    
 I'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this wee@@ k@@ en@@ d.    
 Just wanted to dro@@ p you a no@@ t@@ e.    
 H@@ op@@ e you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, et@@ c@@ .    
 I'm still pretty numb@@ , but no@@ tic@@ ing more moments of really real@@ izing Mi@@ ke isn't coming hom@@ e.    
 Mi@@ ke was dri@@ ving from Pe@@ tal@@ um@@ a to S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o to watch the 4@@ 9@@ ers game with his father on J@@ an@@ u@@ ary 19@@ .    
 He never made it there.    
 I called Pe@@ tal@@ um@@ a poli@@ ce and repor@@ ted him mis@@ sing that even@@ ing.    
 The next morning, two offic@@ ers came to my home and repor@@ ted that Mi@@ k@@ e's car was down at the bri@@ dg@@ e.    
 A wit@@ ness had ob@@ ser@@ ved him ju@@ mp@@ ing off the bridge at 1@@ :@@ 5@@ 8 p@@ .@@ m. the pre@@ vi@@ ous day.    
 Th@@ an@@ ks so much for standing up for those who may be only temp@@ or@@ arily too wea@@ k to stand for them@@ selves.    
 Who ha@@ s@@ n't been low before without suffer@@ ing from a tru@@ e mental ill@@ n@@ ess@@ ?    
 It sh@@ ouldn't be so easy to end it.    
 My p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers are with you for your fi@@ ght.    
 The G@@ G@@ B@@ , G@@ old@@ en G@@ ate B@@ ri@@ dg@@ e, is supposed to be a pas@@ sa@@ ge across our beautiful ba@@ y, not a gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ar@@ d.    
 G@@ ood l@@ uc@@ k this wee@@ k. V@@ ic@@ k@@ y."    
 I can't imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the pat@@ h that her son took that day, and also the courage just to car@@ ry on.    
 I'd like to intro@@ duce you to a man I ref@@ er to as hope and coura@@ g@@ e.    
 On M@@ arch 1@@ 1 of 200@@ 5@@ , I respon@@ ded to a radi@@ o call of a possible suic@@ id@@ al subjec@@ t on the bridge s@@ ide@@ walk near the nor@@ th tow@@ er.    
 I ro@@ de my mo@@ tor@@ cy@@ cle down the s@@ ide@@ walk and ob@@ ser@@ ved this man, K@@ ev@@ in B@@ er@@ thi@@ a, standing on the s@@ ide@@ wal@@ k.    
 When he saw me, he im@@ medi@@ ately tra@@ vers@@ ed that pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an ra@@ il, and st@@ ood on that small pi@@ pe which goes around the tow@@ er.    
 For the next hour and a hal@@ f@@ , I list@@ ened as K@@ ev@@ in spo@@ ke about his de@@ pres@@ sion and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ n@@ ess.    
 K@@ ev@@ in decided on his own that day to come back over that ra@@ il and give life another chan@@ ce.    
 When K@@ ev@@ in came back over@@ , I con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ated him.    
 "@@ This is a new begin@@ ning, a new life@@ ."    
 But I asked him, "What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chan@@ c@@ e@@ ?"    
 And you know what he told me@@ ?    
 He said, "@@ You list@@ en@@ ed.    
 You let me spea@@ k, and you just list@@ en@@ ed@@ ."    
 Sh@@ ort@@ ly after this inc@@ id@@ ent, I recei@@ ved a let@@ ter from K@@ ev@@ in@@ 's mother@@ , and I have that let@@ ter with me, and I'd like to read it to you.    
 "D@@ ea@@ r M@@ r. B@@ ri@@ gg@@ s, No@@ thing will er@@ ase the ev@@ ents of M@@ arch 1@@ 1, but you are one of the reas@@ ons K@@ ev@@ in is still with us.    
 I truly believe K@@ ev@@ in was cr@@ ying out for hel@@ p.    
 He has been di@@ ag@@ no@@ sed with a mental ill@@ ness for which he has been proper@@ ly medi@@ cat@@ ed.    
 I ad@@ op@@ ted K@@ ev@@ in when he was only six months old, completely un@@ aw@@ are of any her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary tra@@ it@@ s, bu@@ t, th@@ ank Go@@ d, now we know.    
 K@@ ev@@ in is stra@@ i@@ ght, as he say@@ s.    
 We truly th@@ ank G@@ od for you.    
 S@@ in@@ cer@@ ely in@@ de@@ b@@ ted to you, N@@ ar@@ v@@ ell@@ a B@@ er@@ thi@@ a@@ ."    
 And on the bo@@ t@@ to@@ m she writ@@ es, "@@ P@@ .@@ S. When I vis@@ ited S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ sc@@ o G@@ en@@ er@@ al H@@ osp@@ ital that even@@ ing, you were list@@ ed as the pati@@ ent.    
 B@@ o@@ y, did I have to stra@@ i@@ ght@@ en that one out@@ ."    
 To@@ day, K@@ ev@@ in is a lo@@ ving father and con@@ tribu@@ ting memb@@ er of societ@@ y.    
 He spea@@ ks op@@ en@@ ly about the ev@@ ents that day and his de@@ pres@@ sion in the hop@@ es that his story will inspi@@ re other@@ s.    
 Su@@ ic@@ ide is not just something I've en@@ coun@@ tered on the job@@ .    
 It's person@@ al.    
 My grand@@ father comm@@ it@@ ted suic@@ ide by po@@ is@@ on@@ ing.    
 That ac@@ t, al@@ though ending his own pa@@ in, rob@@ bed me from ever getting to know him.    
 This is what suic@@ ide do@@ es.    
 For most suic@@ id@@ al fol@@ ks, or those contemp@@ l@@ ating suic@@ id@@ e, they wouldn't think of h@@ ur@@ ting another pers@@ on.    
 They just want their own pa@@ in to en@@ d.    
 T@@ y@@ pic@@ ally, this is ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ed in just three wa@@ y@@ s: sle@@ ep@@ , d@@ ru@@ g@@ s or al@@ co@@ hol@@ , or dea@@ th.    
 In my care@@ er, I've respon@@ ded to and been invol@@ ved in hundreds of mental ill@@ ness and suic@@ ide call@@ s around the bri@@ dg@@ e.    
 O@@ f those inc@@ id@@ ents I've been direc@@ tly invol@@ ved with@@ , I've only lo@@ st tw@@ o, but that's two too man@@ y.    
 One was J@@ as@@ on.    
 The other was a man I spo@@ ke to for about an hour@@ .    
 D@@ ur@@ ing that time, he sh@@ oo@@ k my hand on three oc@@ ca@@ sion@@ s.    
 On that fin@@ al hand@@ sha@@ ke, he looked at me, and he said, "@@ K@@ ev@@ in, I'm sor@@ r@@ y, but I have to go@@ ."    
 And he le@@ ap@@ t.    
 H@@ or@@ ri@@ b@@ le, absolutely hor@@ ri@@ b@@ le.    
 I do want to tell you, thou@@ gh, the v@@ ast maj@@ or@@ ity of fol@@ ks that we do get to cont@@ act on that bridge do not comm@@ it suic@@ id@@ e.    
 A@@ d@@ di@@ tion@@ ally, that very few who have ju@@ mp@@ ed off the bridge and li@@ ved and can talk about it, that one to two perc@@ ent, most of those fol@@ ks have said that the second that they let go of that ra@@ il, they knew that they had made a mista@@ ke and they wanted to liv@@ e.    
 I tell people, the bridge not only connec@@ ts M@@ ar@@ in to S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co@@ , but people together al@@ so@@ .    
 That connec@@ tion, or bridge that we ma@@ ke, is something that each and every one of us should stri@@ ve to do.    
 Su@@ ic@@ ide is pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able.    
 There is hel@@ p. There is hop@@ e.    
 Thank you very much.    
 The world makes you something that you're not, but you know inside what you are, and that question bur@@ ns in your hear@@ t@@ : How will you become that?    
 I may be some@@ what unique in this, but I am not al@@ one, not alone at all.    
 So when I became a fas@@ hi@@ on model@@ , I felt that I'd finally achiev@@ ed the dream that I'd always wanted since I was a young chil@@ d.    
 My outside self finally mat@@ ched my inner tru@@ th, my inner self.    
 For complicated reas@@ ons which I'll get to later, when I look at this pic@@ ture, at that time I felt like, G@@ e@@ en@@ a, you've done it, you've made it, you have arri@@ v@@ ed.    
 But this past O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er, I realized that I'm only just begin@@ n@@ ing.    
 All of us are put in bo@@ x@@ es by our family, by our reli@@ gi@@ on, by our societ@@ y, our moment in hi@@ story, even our own bo@@ di@@ es.    
 Some people have the courage to break fre@@ e, not to acc@@ ept the lim@@ it@@ ations imp@@ osed by the color of their sk@@ in Th@@ ose people are always the thre@@ at to the st@@ at@@ us qu@@ o, to what is consid@@ ered acc@@ ep@@ tab@@ le.    
 In my case, for the last nine years, some of my neighbor@@ s, some of my friends, colleag@@ u@@ es, even my ag@@ ent, did not know about my hi@@ story.    
 I think, in myster@@ y, this is called the re@@ ve@@ al.    
 Here is min@@ e.    
 I was assig@@ ned boy at bir@@ th based on the appe@@ ar@@ ance of my gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a.    
 I remember when I was five years old in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines walking around our hous@@ e, I would always wear this t@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t on my hea@@ d.    
 And my mo@@ m asked me, "@@ How come you always wear that t@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ t on your head@@ ?"    
 I said, "@@ M@@ om@@ , this is my ha@@ ir@@ . I'm a girl@@ ."    
 I knew then how to self-@@ identi@@ f@@ y.    
 G@@ end@@ er has always been consid@@ ered a fact, im@@ mu@@ table, but we now know it's actually more flu@@ id@@ , complex and myster@@ i@@ ous.    
 Because of my succ@@ ess, I never had the courage to share my story, not because I thought what I am is wr@@ ong, but because of how the world tre@@ at@@ s those of us who w@@ ish to break fre@@ e.    
 Every day, I am so gr@@ at@@ e@@ ful because I am a wom@@ an.    
 I have a mo@@ m and da@@ d and family who acc@@ ep@@ ted me for who I am. M@@ any are not so fortun@@ ate.    
 There's a long tra@@ di@@ tion in A@@ si@@ an culture that c@@ ele@@ br@@ ates the flu@@ id myster@@ y of gen@@ d@@ er.    
 There is a Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ist go@@ dd@@ ess of comp@@ as@@ sion.    
 There is a H@@ in@@ d@@ u go@@ d@@ des@@ s, hi@@ j@@ r@@ a go@@ d@@ des@@ s.    
 So when I was eight years old, I was at a fi@@ est@@ a in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines c@@ ele@@ br@@ ating these myster@@ ies.    
 I was in front of the st@@ age, and I rememb@@ er, out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me, and I remember that moment something hit me@@ : That is the kind of woman I would like to be.    
 still dres@@ sing as a bo@@ y, I met this woman nam@@ ed T@@ .@@ L@@ .    
 She is a trans@@ gen@@ der beau@@ ty pa@@ ge@@ ant manag@@ er.    
 That ni@@ ght she asked me, "@@ How come you are not jo@@ ining the beau@@ ty pa@@ ge@@ ant@@ ?"    
 She con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed me that if I jo@@ ined that she would take care of the re@@ gi@@ stra@@ tion fe@@ e and the gar@@ ment@@ s, and that night, I w@@ on best in s@@ wi@@ m@@ su@@ it and best in long go@@ w@@ n and plac@@ ed second run@@ ner up am@@ ong 4@@ 0@@ -@@ pl@@ us can@@ di@@ dat@@ es.    
 That moment changed my life.    
 All of a sudd@@ en, I was intro@@ duc@@ ed to the world of beau@@ ty pa@@ ge@@ an@@ ts.    
 Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pa@@ ge@@ ant qu@@ e@@ en for trans@@ gen@@ der wom@@ en, but I'll take it.    
 So from 15 to 1@@ 7 years old, I jo@@ ined the most pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous pa@@ ge@@ ant to the pa@@ ge@@ ant where it's at the back of the truc@@ k, liter@@ ally, or sometimes it would be a pa@@ v@@ ement next to a ri@@ ce fiel@@ d, and when it ra@@ ins -- it ra@@ ins a lot in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines -- the organ@@ iz@@ ers would have to move it inside some@@ one's hous@@ e.    
 I also experienc@@ ed the goo@@ d@@ ness of strang@@ ers, especially when we would tra@@ vel in re@@ mo@@ te pro@@ v@@ in@@ ces in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ pp@@ in@@ es.    
 But most import@@ ant@@ ly, I met some of my best friends in that commun@@ ity.    
 In 200@@ 1, my mom@@ , who had moved to S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co@@ , called me and told me that my gre@@ en c@@ ard pe@@ ti@@ tion came through@@ , that I could now move to the United St@@ at@@ es.    
 I re@@ sist@@ ed it.    
 I told my mom@@ , "@@ M@@ om@@ , I'm having fun@@ .    
 I'm here with my friends, I love tra@@ vel@@ ing, being a beau@@ ty pa@@ ge@@ ant qu@@ e@@ en@@ ."    
 But then two weeks later she called me, she said, "D@@ id you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gen@@ der mar@@ k@@ er@@ ?"    
 That was all I needed to hear@@ .    
 My mo@@ m also told me to put two E@@ 's in the sp@@ ell@@ ing of my nam@@ e.    
 She also came with me when I had my surg@@ ery in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and at 1@@ 9 years ol@@ d.    
 It's interes@@ ting, in some of the most ru@@ ral cities in T@@ ha@@ il@@ and, they per@@ form some of the most pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous, sa@@ fe and s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated surg@@ er@@ y.    
 At that time in the United St@@ ates, before you could change your name and gen@@ der mar@@ k@@ er.    
 So in 200@@ 1, I moved to S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co@@ , and I remember looking at my Californi@@ a dri@@ ver@@ 's lic@@ en@@ se with the name G@@ e@@ en@@ a and gen@@ der mar@@ k@@ er F@@ .    
 That was a powerful mom@@ ent.    
 For some people, their I@@ .@@ D@@ . is their lic@@ en@@ se to dri@@ ve or even to get a d@@ rin@@ k, but for me, that was my lic@@ en@@ se to liv@@ e, to feel dig@@ ni@@ fi@@ ed.    
 All of a sudd@@ en, my fear@@ s were min@@ im@@ iz@@ ed.    
 I felt that I could con@@ qu@@ er my dream and move to New York and be a model@@ .    
 M@@ any are not so fortun@@ ate.    
 I think of this woman nam@@ ed I@@ s@@ l@@ an N@@ et@@ t@@ les.    
 S@@ he's from New Yor@@ k, she's a young woman who was coura@@ ge@@ ously living her tru@@ th, but h@@ at@@ red ended her life.    
 For most of my commun@@ ity, this is the reality in which we liv@@ e.    
 Our suic@@ ide r@@ ate is nine times high@@ er than that of the gener@@ al popula@@ tion.    
 Every No@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 20@@ , we have a global vi@@ gi@@ l for T@@ ran@@ s@@ gen@@ der D@@ a@@ y of Re@@ memb@@ ran@@ ce.    
 I'm here at this st@@ age because it's a long history of people who f@@ ought and st@@ ood up for in@@ jus@@ tic@@ e.    
 This is M@@ ar@@ sh@@ a P@@ . Jo@@ h@@ n@@ son and S@@ y@@ l@@ vi@@ a Ri@@ ver@@ a.    
 To@@ day, this very mom@@ ent, is my real coming out.    
 I could no longer live my truth for and by my@@ self.    
 I want to do my best to help other@@ s live their truth without sha@@ me and ter@@ r@@ or.    
 I am here, ex@@ po@@ se@@ d, so that one day there will never be a need for a No@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er 20 vi@@ g@@ il.    
 My deep@@ est truth allow@@ ed me to acc@@ ept who I am.    
 W@@ ill you@@ ?    
 Thank you very much.    
   Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. K@@ a@@ th@@ r@@ y@@ n S@@ ch@@ ul@@ z@@ : G@@ e@@ en@@ a, one quic@@ k question for you.    
 I'm wonder@@ ing what you would say, especially to paren@@ ts, but in a more bro@@ ad way, to friends, to family, to anyone who fin@@ ds themselves en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ing a child or a person who is stru@@ gg@@ ling with and un@@ comfor@@ table with a gen@@ der that's being assig@@ ned them, to the family memb@@ ers of that person to help them become good and car@@ ing and kind family memb@@ ers to them@@ ?    
 G@@ e@@ en@@ a R@@ oc@@ er@@ o: Su@@ re. Well, fir@@ st, re@@ ally, I'm so bl@@ es@@ se@@ d.    
 The supp@@ ort system@@ , with my mo@@ m especi@@ ally, and my family, that in itself is just so power@@ ful.    
 I remember every time I would co@@ ach young tr@@ ans wom@@ en, I would ment@@ or them, and sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can't acc@@ ept it, I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom@@ , "@@ M@@ om@@ , can you call this wom@@ an@@ ?"    
 And sometimes it work@@ s, sometimes it does@@ n'@@ t, so — But it's ju@@ st, gen@@ der identity is in the cor@@ e of our be@@ ing, right?    
 I mean, we're all assig@@ ned gen@@ der at bir@@ th, so what I'm trying to do sometimes that gen@@ der assig@@ n@@ ment doesn't mat@@ ch, and there should be a space that would allow people to self-@@ identi@@ f@@ y, and that's a conversation that we should have with paren@@ ts, with colleag@@ u@@ es.    
 The trans@@ gen@@ der mov@@ em@@ ent, to comp@@ are to how the ga@@ y mov@@ ement star@@ ted.    
 There's still a lot of work that needs to be don@@ e.    
 There should be an under@@ stand@@ ing.    
 There should be a space of curi@@ os@@ ity and asking ques@@ tions, and I hope all of you guys will be my al@@ li@@ es.    
 K@@ S: Thank you. That was so lo@@ vel@@ y. G@@ R@@ : Thank you.    
 In many pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l socie@@ ties and tri@@ bal socie@@ ties, father@@ s are usually known by their son@@ s, but I'm one of the few father@@ s who is known by his daugh@@ ter, and I am p@@ rou@@ d of it.    
   M@@ al@@ al@@ a started her camp@@ a@@ ign for edu@@ cation and st@@ ood for her rights in 200@@ 7@@ , and when her eff@@ or@@ ts were hon@@ ore@@ d in 20@@ 1@@ 1, and she was given the national you@@ th pe@@ ace pri@@ z@@ e, and she became a very fam@@ ous, very pop@@ ular young girl of her countr@@ y.    
 Be@@ fore that, she was my daugh@@ ter, but now I am her father@@ .    
 L@@ a@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ m@@ en, if we g@@ lan@@ ce to human hi@@ story, the story of women is the story of in@@ jus@@ tic@@ e, ine@@ qu@@ al@@ ity, violence and explo@@ it@@ ation.    
 You see, in pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l socie@@ ties, right from the very begin@@ ning, when a girl is bor@@ n, her bir@@ th is not c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated.    
 She is not w@@ el@@ com@@ ed, nei@@ ther by father no@@ r by mother@@ .    
 The neighbor@@ hood comes and comm@@ is@@ er@@ ates with the mother@@ , and no@@ body con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ates the father@@ .    
 And a mother is very un@@ comfor@@ table for having a girl chil@@ d.    
 When she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to the first girl chil@@ d, first daugh@@ ter, she is sa@@ d.    
 When she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to the second daugh@@ ter, she is sh@@ oc@@ ke@@ d, and in the expec@@ ta@@ tion of a s@@ on, when she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to a third daugh@@ ter, she feel@@ s gu@@ il@@ ty like a cri@@ min@@ al.    
 Not only the mother suffer@@ s, but the daugh@@ ter, the new@@ ly born daugh@@ ter, when she grow@@ s old, she suffer@@ s too@@ .    
 At the age of fi@@ ve, while she should be going to school, she sta@@ ys at home and her bro@@ ther@@ s are adm@@ it@@ ted in a school.    
 Un@@ til the age of 1@@ 2@@ , some@@ h@@ ow, she has a good life.    
 She can have fun@@ .    
 She can play with her friends in the stre@@ et@@ s, and she can move around in the stree@@ ts like a bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fl@@ y.    
 But when she ent@@ ers her te@@ en@@ s, when she becomes 1@@ 3 years old, she is for@@ b@@ idd@@ en to go out of her home without a male es@@ cor@@ t.    
 She is con@@ fin@@ ed under the four w@@ all@@ s of her hom@@ e.    
 She is no more a free individu@@ al. She becomes the so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or of her father and of her bro@@ ther@@ s and of her family, and if she trans@@ gres@@ ses the code of that so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or, she could even be k@@ il@@ le@@ d.    
 And it is also interesting that this so@@ -@@ called code of hon@@ or, it does not only affec@@ t the life of a girl@@ , it also affec@@ ts the life of the male memb@@ ers of the famil@@ y.    
 I know a family of seven sist@@ ers and one bro@@ ther@@ , and that one bro@@ ther@@ , he has mi@@ gr@@ ated to the G@@ ul@@ f countri@@ es, to ear@@ n a living for his seven sist@@ ers and paren@@ ts, because he thin@@ ks that it will be hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ating if his seven sist@@ ers learn a sk@@ ill and they go out of the home and ear@@ n some liv@@ e@@ li@@ h@@ oo@@ d.    
 So this bro@@ ther@@ , he s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es the jo@@ ys of his life and the happiness of his sist@@ ers at the al@@ ta@@ r of so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or.    
 And there is one more nor@@ m of the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l socie@@ ties that is called o@@ be@@ di@@ ence.    
 A good girl is supposed to be very qui@@ e@@ t, very hu@@ mb@@ le and very sub@@ mis@@ si@@ ve.    
 It is the cr@@ it@@ eri@@ a.    
 The ro@@ le model good girl should be very qui@@ e@@ t.    
 She is supposed to be sil@@ ent and she is supposed to acc@@ ept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of el@@ der@@ s, even if she does not like them.    
 If she is married to a man she doesn't like or if she is married to an old man, she has to acc@@ ep@@ t, because she does not want to be du@@ b@@ bed If she is married very ear@@ ly, she has to acc@@ ep@@ t.    
 O@@ ther@@ wis@@ e, she will be called di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ent.    
 And what happens at the end@@ ?    
 In the words of a po@@ et@@ ess, she is we@@ d@@ ded, be@@ d@@ ded, and then she gi@@ ves bir@@ th to more s@@ ons and daugh@@ ters.    
 And it is the ir@@ on@@ y of the situation that this mother@@ , she teach@@ es the same less@@ on of o@@ be@@ di@@ ence to her daughter and the same less@@ on of hon@@ or to her son@@ s.    
 And this vic@@ i@@ ous cy@@ cle goes on, goes on.    
 L@@ a@@ dies and g@@ ent@@ le@@ m@@ en, this p@@ light of milli@@ ons of women could be changed if we think differ@@ ent@@ ly, if women and men think differ@@ ent@@ ly, if men and women in the tri@@ bal and pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l socie@@ ties in the develop@@ ing countri@@ es, if they can break a few nor@@ ms of family and societ@@ y, if they can abo@@ lish the disc@@ ri@@ min@@ ator@@ y law@@ s of the systems in their st@@ ates, which go against the basic human rights of the wom@@ en.    
 D@@ ea@@ r bro@@ ther@@ s and si@@ ster@@ s, when M@@ al@@ al@@ a was bor@@ n, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like new@@ born children, to be hon@@ es@@ t, but when I went and I looked into her ey@@ es, believe me, I got ex@@ trem@@ ely hon@@ ore@@ d.    
 And long before she was bor@@ n, I thought about her nam@@ e, le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary freedom fi@@ gh@@ ter in Af@@ gh@@ ani@@ stan@@ .    
 H@@ er name was M@@ al@@ al@@ a@@ i of Ma@@ i@@ wan@@ d, and I nam@@ ed my daughter after her@@ .    
 A few days after M@@ al@@ al@@ a was bor@@ n, my daughter was bor@@ n, my cou@@ s@@ in came -- and it was a co@@ inc@@ idence -- he came to my home and he brought a family tre@@ e, a family t@@ ree of the You@@ sa@@ f@@ z@@ a@@ i family, and when I looked at the family tre@@ e, it trac@@ ed back to 3@@ 00 years of our anc@@ es@@ tor@@ s.    
 But when I loo@@ ke@@ d, all were m@@ en, and I pic@@ ked my p@@ en, dre@@ w a line from my nam@@ e, and wro@@ t@@ e, "@@ M@@ al@@ al@@ a@@ ."    
 And when she grow old, when she was four and a half years old, I adm@@ it@@ ted her in my school.    
 You will be as@@ king, then, why should I men@@ tion about the ad@@ mis@@ sion of a girl in a school@@ ?    
 Y@@ es, I must men@@ tion it.    
 It may be taken for gran@@ ted in C@@ an@@ ada@@ , in Ameri@@ ca, in many develop@@ ed countri@@ es, but in po@@ or countri@@ es, in pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ cha@@ l socie@@ ties, in tri@@ bal socie@@ ties, it's a big ev@@ ent for the life of girl@@ .    
 En@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment in a school means recog@@ ni@@ tion of her identity and her nam@@ e.    
 A@@ d@@ mis@@ sion in a school means that she has ent@@ ered the world of dre@@ ams and as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions where she can explor@@ e her pot@@ enti@@ als for her future life.    
 I have five si@@ ster@@ s, and n@@ one of them could go to school, and you will be ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ed, two weeks before@@ , when I was f@@ ill@@ ing out the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an vis@@ a for@@ m, and I was f@@ ill@@ ing out the family part of the for@@ m, I could not rec@@ all the sur@@ nam@@ es of some of my si@@ ster@@ s.    
 And the reason was that I have ne@@ ver, never seen the nam@@ es of my sist@@ ers writ@@ ten on any do@@ cu@@ ment.    
 That was the reason that I valu@@ ed my daugh@@ ter.    
 What my father could not give to my sist@@ ers and to his daugh@@ ters, I thought I must change it.    
 I used to app@@ reci@@ ate the intellig@@ ence and the br@@ illi@@ ance of my daugh@@ ter.    
 I en@@ coura@@ ged her to s@@ it with me when my friends used to com@@ e.    
 I en@@ coura@@ ged her to go with me to different me@@ et@@ ings.    
 And all these good valu@@ es, I tried to in@@ cul@@ c@@ ate in her person@@ al@@ ity.    
 And this was not only sh@@ e, only M@@ al@@ al@@ a.    
 I imp@@ ar@@ ted all these good valu@@ es to my school, girl students and boy students as well.    
 I used edu@@ cation for e@@ man@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion.    
 I taught my girl@@ s, I taught my girl stud@@ ents, to un@@ learn the less@@ on of o@@ be@@ di@@ ence.    
 I taught my boy students to un@@ learn the less@@ on of so@@ -@@ called p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ hon@@ or.    
 D@@ ea@@ r bro@@ ther@@ s and si@@ ster@@ s, we were stri@@ ving for more rights for wom@@ en, and we were stru@@ gg@@ ling to have mo@@ re, more and more space for the women in societ@@ y.    
 But we came across a new ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on.    
 It was le@@ th@@ al to human rights and particularly to wom@@ en@@ 's ri@@ ght@@ s.    
 It was called T@@ ali@@ ban@@ iz@@ ation.    
 It means a comple@@ te ne@@ g@@ ation of wom@@ en@@ 's partici@@ pa@@ tion in all poli@@ tic@@ al, econom@@ ical and social ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ ties.    
 H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of school@@ s were lo@@ st.    
 G@@ ir@@ ls were pro@@ hi@@ b@@ ited from going to school.    
 W@@ om@@ en were forced to wear ve@@ ils and they were stopped from going to the marke@@ ts.    
 M@@ us@@ ici@@ ans were sil@@ enc@@ ed, girls were f@@ log@@ ged and sing@@ ers were k@@ il@@ le@@ d.    
 M@@ illi@@ ons were suffer@@ ing, but few spo@@ ke, and it was the most sc@@ ary thing who kill and who f@@ log@@ , and you speak for your ri@@ ght@@ s.    
 It's really the most sc@@ ary thing.    
 At the age of 10@@ , M@@ al@@ al@@ a st@@ oo@@ d, and she st@@ ood for the right of edu@@ ca@@ tion.    
 She wrote a di@@ ary for the B@@ B@@ C b@@ log@@ , she volunte@@ ered her@@ self for the New York T@@ im@@ es do@@ cu@@ ment@@ ari@@ es, and she spo@@ ke from every pl@@ at@@ form she cou@@ l@@ d.    
 And her vo@@ ice was the most powerful voic@@ e.    
 It sp@@ read like a cre@@ scen@@ do all around the world.    
 And that was the reason the T@@ ali@@ b@@ an could not t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate her camp@@ a@@ ig@@ n, and on O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 9 20@@ 1@@ 2@@ , she was sho@@ t in the head at point bl@@ ank ran@@ g@@ e.    
 It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me.    
 The world turned into a big black ho@@ le.    
 Wh@@ i@@ le my daughter was on the ver@@ ge of life and dea@@ th, I wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of my wi@@ f@@ e, "@@ Sh@@ ould I be bl@@ am@@ ed for what happened to my daughter and your daugh@@ ter@@ ?"    
 And she ab@@ ru@@ p@@ tly told me, "@@ P@@ le@@ ase don't bl@@ ame your@@ self.    
 You st@@ ood for the right caus@@ e.    
 You put your life at sta@@ ke for the cause of tru@@ th, for the cause of pe@@ ac@@ e, and for the cause of edu@@ cation, and your daughter in inspi@@ red from you and she jo@@ ined you.    
 You both were on the right pat@@ h and G@@ od will prote@@ ct her@@ ."    
 These few words me@@ ant a lot to me, and I didn't ask this question again.    
 When M@@ al@@ al@@ a was in the hosp@@ it@@ al, and she was going through the sever@@ e pa@@ ins and she had had sever@@ e head@@ ach@@ es because her fac@@ ial ner@@ ve was c@@ ut dow@@ n, I used to see a dar@@ k sha@@ do@@ w sp@@ reading on the face of my wi@@ f@@ e. But my daughter never comp@@ la@@ in@@ ed.    
 She used to tell us, "I'm f@@ ine with my c@@ roo@@ ked s@@ mi@@ le and with my numb@@ ness in my fac@@ e.    
 I'll be oka@@ y. P@@ le@@ ase don't wor@@ r@@ y."    
 She was a sol@@ ace for us, and she con@@ sol@@ ed us.    
 D@@ ea@@ r bro@@ ther@@ s and si@@ ster@@ s, we learned from her how to be re@@ si@@ li@@ ent in the most difficult times, and I'm g@@ la@@ d to share with you for the rights of children and wom@@ en, she is like any 1@@ 6@@ -@@ year old girl@@ .    
 She cri@@ es when her home@@ work is in@@ comple@@ t@@ e.    
 She quar@@ rel@@ s with her bro@@ ther@@ s, and I am very happy for that.    
 People ask me, what speci@@ al is in my ment@@ or@@ ship which has made M@@ al@@ al@@ a so bo@@ ld and so coura@@ ge@@ ous and so vo@@ cal and po@@ i@@ se@@ d?    
 I tell them, don't ask me what I di@@ d.    
 A@@ s@@ k me what I did not do.    
 I did not cli@@ p her w@@ ings, and that's all.    
 Thank you very much.    
   Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.     
 I had brain surg@@ ery 1@@ 8 years ago, and since that time, brain science has become a person@@ al passion of min@@ e.    
 I'm actually an engine@@ er.    
 And first let me say, I rec@@ ently jo@@ ined Goog@@ le@@ 's Mo@@ on@@ sho@@ t grou@@ p, where I had a di@@ vi@@ sion, the disp@@ la@@ y di@@ vi@@ sion in Goog@@ le X@@ , and the brain science work I'm spea@@ king about today is work I did before I jo@@ ined Goog@@ le and on the side outside of Goog@@ le.    
 So that said, there's a sti@@ g@@ m@@ a when you have brain surg@@ er@@ y.    
 Are you still smar@@ t or no@@ t?    
 And if not, can you make your@@ self smar@@ t again@@ ?    
 Af@@ ter my neuro@@ surg@@ er@@ y, part of my brain was mis@@ s@@ ing, and I had to deal with that.    
 It wasn't the gre@@ y mat@@ ter, but it was the goo@@ ey part de@@ ad cent@@ er that makes key hor@@ mon@@ es and neuro@@ tran@@ sm@@ it@@ ters.    
 I@@ m@@ medi@@ ately after my surg@@ er@@ y, I had to dec@@ ide what amoun@@ ts of each of over a do@@ z@@ en powerful chemic@@ als to take each day, because if I just took no@@ thing, I would di@@ e within hour@@ s.    
 Every day now for 1@@ 8 years -- every single day -- I've had to try to dec@@ ide the comb@@ in@@ ations and mi@@ x@@ tures of chemic@@ als, and try to get them, to sta@@ y ali@@ ve.    
 There have been several close call@@ s.    
 But luck@@ il@@ y, I'm an experi@@ ment@@ al@@ ist at hear@@ t, so I decided I would experi@@ ment to try to find more op@@ ti@@ mal d@@ os@@ ages because there really isn't a cle@@ ar road ma@@ p on this that's deta@@ i@@ le@@ d.    
 I began to try different mi@@ x@@ tures, and I was b@@ low@@ n away by how tiny changes in d@@ os@@ ages drama@@ tically changed my sense of self, my sense of who I was, my thinking, my behavi@@ or towards people.    
 One particularly drama@@ tic ca@@ se@@ : for a couple months I actually tried d@@ os@@ ages and chemic@@ als typical of a man in his ear@@ ly 20@@ s, and I was b@@ low@@ n away by how my thou@@ ghts chan@@ ge@@ d.    
   I was an@@ gr@@ y all the time, I thought about sex con@@ stan@@ t@@ ly, and I thought I was the smar@@ test person in the entire world, and —@@ — of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that, or maybe kind of ton@@ ed@@ -@@ down ver@@ sions of that.    
 I was kind of ex@@ tre@@ me.    
 But to me, the surpri@@ se was, I wasn't trying to be ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant.    
 with a little bit of in@@ se@@ cur@@ ity, to actually fi@@ x a problem in front of me, and it just didn't come out that way.    
 So I couldn't hand@@ le it.    
 I changed my d@@ os@@ ag@@ es.    
 But that experienc@@ e, I think, gave me a new app@@ reci@@ ation for men and I've gotten along with men a lot better since th@@ en.    
 What I was trying to do with tu@@ ning these hor@@ mon@@ es and neuro@@ tran@@ sm@@ it@@ ters and so for@@ th was to try to get my intellig@@ ence back after my ill@@ ness and surg@@ er@@ y, my creative thought, my idea flow@@ .    
 and so for me that became a key me@@ tri@@ c -- how to get these mental images that I use as a way of ra@@ pi@@ d pro@@ to@@ typ@@ ing, if you will@@ , my ide@@ as, trying on different new ideas for si@@ z@@ e, playing out scen@@ ari@@ o@@ s.    
 This kind of thinking isn't new@@ .    
 P@@ hi@@ li@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers like H@@ u@@ me and D@@ es@@ car@@ tes and H@@ ob@@ b@@ es saw things si@@ mil@@ ar@@ ly.    
 They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing.    
 There are those today that disp@@ u@@ te that, and lots of de@@ b@@ ates about how the mind work@@ s, but for me it's simp@@ le@@ : M@@ ent@@ al imag@@ es, for most of us, are cent@@ ral in inv@@ enti@@ ve and creative thin@@ king.    
 So after several years, I tu@@ ned myself up and I have lots of great@@ , really vi@@ vi@@ d mental images with a lot of s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ ti@@ cation and the an@@ aly@@ tical back@@ b@@ one behind them.    
 And so now I'm working on, how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer scre@@ en fa@@ ster@@ ?    
 Can you imagin@@ e, if you will@@ , a movie direc@@ tor being able to use her imagin@@ ation alone to direc@@ t the world in front of her@@ ?    
 Or a mus@@ ic@@ ian to get the music out of his head@@ ?    
 as a way for creative people to share at light spe@@ ed.    
 And the truth is, the re@@ ma@@ ining bo@@ tt@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k in being able to do this is just u@@ pp@@ ing the res@@ olu@@ tion of brain s@@ can system@@ s.    
 So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting there by sh@@ aring with you two recent experi@@ ments from two top neuro@@ science grou@@ p@@ s.    
 B@@ o@@ th used f@@ M@@ R@@ I technology -- fun@@ c@@ tional magne@@ tic res@@ on@@ ance imag@@ ing technology -- to image the bra@@ in, and here is a brain s@@ can set from G@@ i@@ or@@ gi@@ o G@@ an@@ is and his colleag@@ u@@ es at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ar@@ d.    
 And the lef@@ t@@ -@@ hand col@@ um@@ n show@@ s a brain s@@ can of a person looking at an imag@@ e.    
 The middle col@@ um@@ n show@@ s the bra@@ in@@ s@@ can of that same individual imagin@@ ing, seeing that same imag@@ e.    
 And the right col@@ um@@ n was created by sub@@ trac@@ ting the middle col@@ um@@ n from the left col@@ um@@ n, showing the difference to be nearly zer@@ o.    
 This was re@@ pe@@ ated on lots of different individu@@ als with lots of different imag@@ es, always with a si@@ mil@@ ar resul@@ t.    
 The difference between seeing an image and imagin@@ ing seeing that same image is next to no@@ thing.    
 N@@ ext let me share with you one other experi@@ ment, this from J@@ ack G@@ all@@ an@@ t's la@@ b at C@@ al B@@ er@@ k@@ ele@@ y.    
 The@@ y@@ 've been able to de@@ code bra@@ in@@ wa@@ ves into recog@@ n@@ iz@@ able vi@@ su@@ al fiel@@ ds.    
 So let me set this up for you.    
 In this experi@@ ment, individu@@ als were shown hundreds of hours of You@@ T@@ u@@ be vide@@ os while s@@ can@@ s were made of their bra@@ ins to create a large li@@ br@@ ary of their brain reac@@ ting to video sequ@@ enc@@ es.    
 Then a new movie was shown with new imag@@ es, new people, new anim@@ als in it, and a new s@@ can set was rec@@ or@@ de@@ d.    
 The compu@@ ter, using brain s@@ can data al@@ one, de@@ co@@ ded that new brain s@@ can to show what it thought the individual was actually see@@ ing.    
 On the ri@@ ght@@ -@@ hand sid@@ e, you see the compu@@ ter@@ 's gu@@ ess, and on the lef@@ t@@ -@@ hand sid@@ e, the present@@ ed cli@@ p.    
 This is the j@@ aw@@ -@@ dro@@ p@@ per@@ .    
 We are so close to being able to do this.    
 We just need to up the res@@ olu@@ tion.    
 And now remember that when you see an image ver@@ su@@ s when you imagine that same imag@@ e, it cre@@ ates the same brain s@@ can@@ .    
 So this was done with the high@@ est@@ -@@ res@@ olu@@ tion brain s@@ can systems avail@@ able today, and their res@@ olu@@ tion has increas@@ ed really about a thous@@ an@@ d@@ f@@ old in the last several years.    
 N@@ ext we need to increase the res@@ olu@@ tion another thous@@ an@@ d@@ f@@ old to get a deep@@ er g@@ li@@ mp@@ se.    
 How do we do that?    
 There's a lot of techniques in this approach@@ .    
 One way is to crac@@ k open your sk@@ ul@@ l and put in elec@@ tro@@ d@@ es.    
 I'm not for that.    
 There's a lot of new imag@@ ing techniques being pro@@ po@@ se@@ d, some even by me, but given the recent success of M@@ R@@ I@@ , first we need to ask the ques@@ tion, is it the end of the road with this technolog@@ y?    
 Con@@ ven@@ tional wis@@ dom says the only way to get high@@ er res@@ olu@@ tion is with bigg@@ er magne@@ ts, but at this point bigg@@ er magne@@ ts only offer incre@@ mental res@@ olu@@ tion impro@@ v@@ em@@ ents, not the thous@@ an@@ d@@ f@@ old we ne@@ ed.    
 I'm putting forward an idea@@ : instead of bigg@@ er magne@@ ts, let's make better magne@@ ts.    
 There's some new technology brea@@ k@@ through@@ s when appli@@ ed to magne@@ tic struc@@ tures that have created a whole new class of magne@@ ts, and with these magne@@ ts, we can la@@ y down very f@@ ine deta@@ il@@ ed magne@@ tic fiel@@ d patter@@ ns through@@ out the bra@@ in, and using th@@ os@@ e, we can actually create ho@@ lo@@ graph@@ ic@@ -@@ like inter@@ fer@@ ence struc@@ tures to get pre@@ ci@@ sion control over many patter@@ n@@ s, as is shown here by shi@@ f@@ ting things. We can create much more complicated struc@@ tures with sli@@ ght@@ ly different ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment@@ s,    
 kind of like making S@@ pi@@ ro@@ graph@@ .    
 So why does that mat@@ ter@@ ?    
 A lot of eff@@ ort in M@@ R@@ I over the years has gone into making really bi@@ g, really huge magne@@ ts, right?    
 But yet most of the recent adv@@ anc@@ es in res@@ olu@@ tion have actually come from ing@@ en@@ i@@ ously cle@@ ver enc@@ o@@ ding and de@@ co@@ ding solu@@ tions in the F@@ .@@ M@@ . radi@@ o fre@@ qu@@ ency tran@@ sm@@ it@@ ters and recei@@ ver@@ s in the M@@ R@@ I system@@ s.    
 Let's al@@ so, instead of a uni@@ form magne@@ tic fiel@@ d, put down struc@@ ture@@ d magne@@ tic patter@@ ns in ad@@ di@@ tion to the F@@ .@@ M@@ . radi@@ o fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es.    
 So by comb@@ ining the magne@@ tics patter@@ ns with the patter@@ ns in the F@@ .@@ M@@ . radi@@ o fre@@ qu@@ en@@ ci@@ es process@@ ing which can mas@@ si@@ vel@@ y increase the information that we can ex@@ tr@@ act in a single s@@ can@@ .    
 And on top of that, we can then lay@@ er our ever@@ -@@ growing knowledge of brain struc@@ ture and memory to create a thous@@ an@@ d@@ f@@ old increase that we ne@@ ed.    
 And using f@@ M@@ R@@ I@@ , we should be able to measure not just o@@ x@@ y@@ gen@@ ated blood flow@@ , but the hor@@ mon@@ es and neuro@@ tran@@ sm@@ it@@ ters I've talked about and maybe even the direc@@ t ne@@ u@@ ral ac@@ tiv@@ ity, which is the dre@@ am.    
 We're going to be able to du@@ m@@ p our ideas direc@@ tly to digital medi@@ a.    
 C@@ ould you imagine if we could le@@ ap@@ f@@ ro@@ g language and communic@@ ate direc@@ tly with human thou@@ ght?    
 What would we be cap@@ able of th@@ en@@ ?    
 And how will we learn to deal with the tru@@ th@@ s of un@@ fil@@ tered human thou@@ ght?    
 You think the Inter@@ net was bi@@ g@@ .    
 These are huge ques@@ tions.    
 It might be ir@@ re@@ si@@ sti@@ ble as a tool to am@@ p@@ lif@@ y our thinking and communi@@ cation sk@@ ill@@ s.    
 And in@@ de@@ ed, this very same tool may pro@@ ve to le@@ ad to the cu@@ re for Al@@ z@@ he@@ i@@ mer@@ 's and si@@ mil@@ ar diseas@@ es.    
 We have little op@@ tion but to open this do@@ or.    
 Re@@ gar@@ d@@ l@@ ess, pick a year -- will it happen in five years or 15 year@@ s?    
 It's hard to imagine it taking much long@@ er.    
 We need to learn how to take this step together.    
 Thank you.    
 I'm going to talk to you ton@@ ight about coming out of the close@@ t, and not in the tra@@ di@@ tional sen@@ se, not just the ga@@ y close@@ t.    
 I think we all have close@@ ts.    
 Y@@ our clo@@ set may be telling someone you love her for the first time, or telling someone that you're pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant, or telling someone you have can@@ c@@ er, or any of the other hard conversa@@ tions we have through@@ out our lives.    
 All a clo@@ set is is a hard conversa@@ tion, and al@@ though our top@@ ics may v@@ ary trem@@ end@@ ous@@ ly, the experience of being in and coming out of the clo@@ set is uni@@ vers@@ al.    
 It is sc@@ ar@@ y, and we h@@ ate it, and it needs to be don@@ e.    
 S@@ ever@@ al years ago, I was working at the South S@@ ide W@@ al@@ n@@ ut C@@ af@@ e, a local d@@ in@@ er in tow@@ n, and during my time there I would go through p@@ ha@@ ses of mil@@ it@@ ant l@@ es@@ bi@@ an in@@ ten@@ sit@@ y@@ : not sha@@ ving my ar@@ mp@@ it@@ s, qu@@ o@@ ting An@@ i Di@@ Fran@@ c@@ o ly@@ ri@@ c@@ s as go@@ sp@@ el@@ .    
 And dep@@ ending on the b@@ ag@@ g@@ iness of my car@@ go shor@@ ts and how rec@@ ently I had sha@@ ved my hea@@ d, the question would often be sp@@ run@@ g on me, usually by a little kid@@ : "@@ U@@ m, are you a boy or are you a girl@@ ?"    
 And there would be an aw@@ k@@ ward sil@@ ence at the tab@@ le.    
 I'd cl@@ enc@@ h my j@@ a@@ w a little ti@@ gh@@ ter, hold my co@@ ff@@ e@@ e po@@ t with a little more ven@@ ge@@ anc@@ e.    
 The da@@ d would aw@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ly sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le his new@@ sp@@ ap@@ er and the mo@@ m would sh@@ oo@@ t a ch@@ ill@@ ing st@@ are at her kid@@ .    
 But I would say no@@ thing, and I would see@@ the insid@@ e.    
 And it got to the point where every time I walked up to a table that had a kid any@@ where between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fi@@ ght.    
   And that is a terri@@ ble feel@@ ing.    
 So I prom@@ is@@ ed my@@ self, the next time, I would say some@@ thing.    
 I would have that hard conversa@@ tion.    
 So within a matter of wee@@ ks, it happens again.    
 "A@@ re you a boy or are you a girl@@ ?"    
 F@@ am@@ ili@@ ar sil@@ ence, but this time I'm read@@ y, and I am about to go all W@@ om@@ en@@ 's S@@ tu@@ dies 10@@ 1 on this tab@@ le. I've got my Be@@ t@@ ty Fri@@ ed@@ an qu@@ o@@ t@@ es.    
 I've got my G@@ l@@ ori@@ a Ste@@ ine@@ m qu@@ o@@ t@@ es.    
 I've even got this little bit from "@@ V@@ ag@@ in@@ a M@@ on@@ o@@ lo@@ gu@@ es@@ " I'm going to do.    
 So I take a de@@ ep b@@ re@@ ath and I look down and star@@ ing back at me is a four@@ -year-old girl in a p@@ ink dres@@ s, not a challenge to a femin@@ ist du@@ el, just a kid with a ques@@ tion@@ : "A@@ re you a boy or are you a girl@@ ?"    
 So I take another de@@ ep brea@@ th, squ@@ at down to next to her, and say, "H@@ e@@ y, I know it's kind of conf@@ us@@ ing.    
 My ha@@ ir is short like a bo@@ y@@ '@@ s, and I wear bo@@ y's clo@@ th@@ es, but I'm a girl@@ , and you know how sometimes you like to wear a p@@ ink dres@@ s, and sometimes you like to wear your com@@ fy j@@ am@@ mi@@ es?    
 Well, I'm more of a com@@ fy j@@ am@@ mi@@ es kind of girl@@ ."    
 And this kid looks me de@@ ad in the ey@@ e, without mis@@ sing a be@@ at, and says, "@@ My favorite pa@@ j@@ am@@ as are pur@@ ple with fish@@ .    
 Can I get a pan@@ ca@@ ke, ple@@ as@@ e@@ ?"    
   And that was it. J@@ u@@ st, "O@@ h, oka@@ y. You're a girl@@ .    
 How about that pan@@ ca@@ ke@@ ?"    
 It was the eas@@ i@@ est hard conversation I have ever ha@@ d.    
 And wh@@ y? Because P@@ an@@ ca@@ ke G@@ ir@@ l and I@@ , we were both real with each other.    
 So like many of us, I've li@@ ved in a few close@@ ts in my life, and yea@@ h, most of@@ t@@ en, my w@@ all@@ s happened to be ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w@@ .    
 But insid@@ e, in the dar@@ k, you can't tell what color the w@@ all@@ s are.    
 You just know what it feel@@ s like to live in a close@@ t.    
 So re@@ ally, my clo@@ set is no different than your@@ s or your@@ s or your@@ s.    
 Su@@ re, I'll give you 100 reas@@ ons why coming out of my clo@@ set was har@@ der than coming out of your@@ s, but here's the thing@@ : H@@ ard is not rela@@ tive.    
 H@@ ard is har@@ d.    
 Who can tell me that expla@@ ining to someone you've just dec@@ la@@ red ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ c@@ y is har@@ der than telling someone you just che@@ ated on them@@ ?    
 Who can tell me that his coming out story is har@@ der than telling your fi@@ ve@@ -year-old you're getting a di@@ vor@@ c@@ e?    
 There is no har@@ d@@ er, there is just har@@ d.    
 We need to stop ran@@ king our hard against everyone el@@ se@@ 's hard to make us feel better or worse about our close@@ ts and just comm@@ is@@ er@@ ate on the fact that we all have har@@ d.    
 At some point in our liv@@ es, we all live in close@@ ts, and they may feel sa@@ f@@ e, or at least sa@@ f@@ er than what li@@ es on the other side of that do@@ or.    
 But I am here to tell you, no matter what your w@@ all@@ s are made of, a clo@@ set is no place for a person to liv@@ e.    
 Th@@ an@@ ks. So imagine your@@ self 20 years ago.    
 M@@ e, I had a p@@ on@@ y@@ ta@@ il, a stra@@ pl@@ ess dres@@ s, and high@@ -@@ he@@ el@@ ed sho@@ es.    
 I was not the mil@@ it@@ ant l@@ es@@ bi@@ an ready to fi@@ ght any four@@ -year-old that walked into the ca@@ f@@ e.    
 I was f@@ ro@@ z@@ en by fear@@ , cur@@ led up in the cor@@ ner of my p@@ it@@ ch@@ -@@ black clo@@ set cl@@ ut@@ ching my ga@@ y gre@@ n@@ ad@@ e, and moving one mus@@ cle is the sc@@ ari@@ est thing I have ever don@@ e.    
 My family, my friends, comple@@ te strang@@ ers -- I had spent my entire life trying to not disap@@ point these people, and now I was tur@@ ning the world up@@ side down on pur@@ pos@@ e.    
 I was bur@@ ning the p@@ ages of the sc@@ ri@@ p@@ t we had all follow@@ ed for so long@@ , but if you do not th@@ row that gre@@ n@@ ad@@ e, it will kill you.    
 One of my most memor@@ able gre@@ n@@ ad@@ e t@@ os@@ ses was at my si@@ ster@@ 's we@@ dd@@ ing.    
   It was the first time that many in att@@ end@@ ance knew I was ga@@ y, so in doing my ma@@ id of hon@@ or du@@ ties, in my black dres@@ s and he@@ el@@ s, I walked around to tab@@ les and finally lan@@ ded on a table of my paren@@ t@@ s' friends, And after a little small tal@@ k, one of the women sh@@ ou@@ ted out, "I love Na@@ than L@@ an@@ e@@ !@@ "    
 And the bat@@ tle of ga@@ y re@@ lat@@ ability had beg@@ un@@ .    
 "A@@ sh@@ , have you ever been to the C@@ ast@@ ro@@ ?"    
 "Well, yea@@ h, actu@@ ally, we have friends in S@@ an Fran@@ ci@@ s@@ co@@ ."    
 "Well, we've never been there but we've heard it's f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous@@ ."    
 "A@@ sh@@ , do you know my ha@@ ir@@ dres@@ s@@ er An@@ ton@@ i@@ o@@ ?    
 H@@ e's really good and he has never talked about a girl@@ friend@@ ."    
 "A@@ sh@@ , what's your favorite T@@ V show@@ ?    
 Our favorite T@@ V show@@ ? F@@ a@@ vor@@ it@@ e: W@@ ill & G@@ rac@@ e.    
 And you know who we lo@@ ve@@ ? J@@ ac@@ k.    
 J@@ ack is our favor@@ it@@ e."    
 And then one wom@@ an, stu@@ mp@@ ed but wan@@ ting so des@@ per@@ ately to show her supp@@ or@@ t, to let me know she was on my sid@@ e, she finally bl@@ ur@@ ted out, "Well, sometimes my h@@ us@@ b@@ and we@@ ars p@@ ink sh@@ ir@@ t@@ s."    
   And I had a choice in that mom@@ ent, as all gre@@ n@@ ad@@ e th@@ row@@ ers do.    
 I could go back to my girl@@ friend and my ga@@ y@@ -@@ lo@@ ving table and mo@@ ck their respon@@ s@@ es, cha@@ sti@@ se their un@@ world@@ lin@@ ess and their in@@ ability to ju@@ m@@ p through the poli@@ tically cor@@ rec@@ t ga@@ y ho@@ op@@ s I had brought with me, or I could emp@@ a@@ th@@ ize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the har@@ d@@ est things they had ever don@@ e, that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their close@@ ts.    
 Su@@ re, it would have been easy to point out where they felt shor@@ t.    
 It's a lot har@@ der to meet them where they are and ac@@ knowledge the fact that they were tr@@ y@@ ing.    
 And what else can you ask someone to do but tr@@ y?    
 If you're going to be real with some@@ one, you go@@ tt@@ a be ready for real in re@@ tur@@ n.    
 So hard conversa@@ tions are still not my strong su@@ it.    
 A@@ s@@ k anybody I have ever dat@@ ed.    
 But I'm getting bet@@ ter, and I follow what I like to call the three P@@ an@@ ca@@ ke G@@ ir@@ l prin@@ ci@@ pl@@ es.    
 Now, please view this through ga@@ y@@ -@@ co@@ lo@@ red l@@ en@@ s@@ es, but know what it takes to come out of any clo@@ set is ess@@ entially the sam@@ e.    
 N@@ u@@ mb@@ er one@@ : B@@ e au@@ th@@ enti@@ c@@ .    
 T@@ a@@ ke the ar@@ m@@ or off. B@@ e your@@ self.    
 That kid in the ca@@ fe had no ar@@ mor@@ , but I was ready for b@@ att@@ le.    
 If you want someone to be real with you, they need to know that you b@@ le@@ ed too@@ .    
 N@@ u@@ mb@@ er tw@@ o: B@@ e direc@@ t. Just say it. Ri@@ p the B@@ an@@ d-@@ A@@ id off.    
 If you know you are ga@@ y, just say it.    
 If you tell your parents you might be ga@@ y, they will hold out hope that this will change.    
 Do not give them that sense of f@@ al@@ se hop@@ e.    
   And number thre@@ e, and most important -- B@@ e un@@ a@@ po@@ lo@@ ge@@ tic.    
 You are spea@@ king your tru@@ th.    
 N@@ ever a@@ po@@ logi@@ ze for that.    
 And some fol@@ ks may have gotten h@@ ur@@ t along the way, so su@@ re, a@@ po@@ logi@@ ze for what you've don@@ e, but never a@@ po@@ logi@@ ze for who you are.    
 And yea@@ h, some fol@@ ks may be disap@@ poin@@ ted, but that is on them, not on you.    
 Th@@ ose are their expec@@ ta@@ tions of who you are, not your@@ s.    
 That is their story, not your@@ s.    
 The only story that mat@@ ters is the one that you want to writ@@ e.    
 So the next time you find your@@ self in a p@@ it@@ ch@@ -@@ black clo@@ set cl@@ ut@@ ching your gre@@ n@@ ad@@ e, know we have all been there before.    
 And you may feel so very al@@ one, but you are no@@ t.    
 And we know it's hard but we need you out here, no matter what your w@@ all@@ s are made of, because I gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e you there are other@@ s pe@@ ering through the ke@@ y@@ hol@@ es of their close@@ ts looking for the next bra@@ ve sou@@ l to b@@ ust a door op@@ en, so be that person and show the world that we are bigg@@ er than our close@@ ts and that a clo@@ set is no place for a person to truly liv@@ e.    
 Thank you, B@@ oul@@ d@@ er. En@@ jo@@ y your ni@@ ght.     
 In@@ tellig@@ ence -- what is it?    
 If we take a look back at the history of how intellig@@ ence has been vi@@ e@@ we@@ d, one se@@ min@@ al example has been E@@ ds@@ g@@ er Di@@ j@@ k@@ stra@@ 's fam@@ ous qu@@ o@@ te that "@@ the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a sub@@ mar@@ ine can s@@ wi@@ m@@ ."    
 Now, E@@ ds@@ g@@ er Di@@ j@@ k@@ stra@@ , when he wrote this, in@@ t@@ ended it as a cri@@ tici@@ s@@ m of the ear@@ ly pi@@ one@@ ers of computer sci@@ ence, like Al@@ an T@@ ur@@ ing. H@@ o@@ we@@ ver, if you take a look back and think about what have been that en@@ ab@@ led us to build arti@@ fic@@ ial mach@@ ines that s@@ wi@@ m and arti@@ fic@@ ial mach@@ ines that [@@ fl@@ y@@ ]@@ , you find that it was only through understanding the under@@ l@@ ying physical mechan@@ is@@ ms of s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing and f@@ light that we were able to build these mach@@ in@@ es.    
 And so, several years ago, I under@@ took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechan@@ is@@ ms under@@ l@@ ying intellig@@ ence.    
 Let's take a step back.    
 Let's first begin with a thought experi@@ ment.    
 P@@ re@@ t@@ end that you're an ali@@ en rac@@ e that doesn't know anything about Earth bio@@ logy or Earth neuro@@ science or Earth intellig@@ ence, but you have amazing tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es and you're able to watch the Ear@@ th, and you have ama@@ z@@ ingly long liv@@ es, so you're able to watch the Earth over milli@@ on@@ s, even billi@@ ons of years.    
 And you ob@@ ser@@ ve a really str@@ ange effec@@ t.    
 You ob@@ ser@@ ve that, over the course of the m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a, Earth is contin@@ u@@ ally b@@ om@@ bar@@ ded with a@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ s up until a poin@@ t, and that at some poin@@ t, cor@@ respon@@ ding rou@@ gh@@ ly to our year, 200@@ 0 A@@ D@@ , a@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ s that are on a col@@ li@@ sion course with the Earth that other@@ w@@ ise would have col@@ li@@ ded myster@@ i@@ ously get def@@ lec@@ ted or they de@@ ton@@ ate before they can hit the Ear@@ th.    
 Now of course, as ear@@ th@@ l@@ ings, we know the reason would be that we're trying to save our@@ selves.    
 We're trying to pre@@ v@@ ent an imp@@ ac@@ t.    
 But if you're an ali@@ en rac@@ e who doesn't know any of this, doesn't have any concept of Earth intellig@@ ence, you'd be forced to put together a physical theor@@ y that expla@@ ins h@@ ow, up until a certain point in time, a@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ s that would demo@@ lish the sur@@ face of a plan@@ et myster@@ i@@ ously stop doing that.    
 And so I cla@@ i@@ m that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intellig@@ ence.    
 So in this program that I under@@ took several years ago, I looked at a vari@@ e@@ ty of different th@@ read@@ s across sci@@ ence, across a vari@@ e@@ ty of di@@ sci@@ pl@@ in@@ es, that were poin@@ ting, I think, towards a sing@@ le, under@@ l@@ ying mechan@@ ism for intellig@@ ence.    
 In c@@ os@@ mo@@ log@@ y, for example, there have been a vari@@ e@@ ty of different th@@ read@@ s of evidence that our univer@@ se appe@@ ars to be fin@@ ely tu@@ ned for the development of intellig@@ ence, and, in particul@@ ar, for the development of uni@@ vers@@ al st@@ ates that maxim@@ ize the di@@ versity of possible fu@@ ture@@ s.    
 In game pla@@ y, for example, in G@@ o -- when I@@ B@@ M@@ 's D@@ e@@ ep B@@ l@@ ue be@@ at G@@ ar@@ ry K@@ as@@ par@@ o@@ v at ch@@ ess -- fe@@ w@@ er people are aw@@ are that in the past 10 years or so, the game of G@@ o, argu@@ ably a much more challeng@@ ing game because it has a much high@@ er bran@@ ching fac@@ tor@@ , has also started to su@@ c@@ cu@@ m@@ b to computer game play@@ ers for the same reas@@ on@@ : the best techniques right now for compu@@ ters playing G@@ o are techniques that try to maxim@@ ize future op@@ tions    
 during game pla@@ y.    
 F@@ in@@ ally, in robo@@ tic mo@@ tion plan@@ ning, there have been a vari@@ e@@ ty of recent techniques that have tried to take adv@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of ab@@ ili@@ ties of robo@@ ts to maxim@@ ize future freedom of ac@@ tion in order to ac@@ comp@@ lish complex t@@ as@@ ks.    
 And so, taking all of these different th@@ read@@ s and putting them together, I as@@ ke@@ d, starting several years ago, is there an under@@ l@@ ying mechan@@ ism for intellig@@ ence that we can fac@@ tor out of all of these different th@@ read@@ s?    
 Is there a single equ@@ ation for intellig@@ enc@@ e?    
 And the answ@@ er, I believ@@ e, is y@@ es. [@@ "@@ F = T ∇ S@@ τ@@ "@@ ] What you're seeing is probably the clo@@ s@@ est e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent to an E = m@@ c@@ ² for intellig@@ ence that I've se@@ en.    
 So what you're seeing here is a st@@ at@@ ement of cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ence that intellig@@ ence is a forc@@ e, F@@ , that ac@@ ts so as to maxim@@ ize future freedom of ac@@ tion.    
 It ac@@ ts to maxim@@ ize future freedom of ac@@ tion, or keep op@@ tions op@@ en, with some st@@ ren@@ g@@ th T@@ , with the di@@ versity of possible acc@@ es@@ sible fu@@ tures, S@@ , up to some future time hor@@ iz@@ on, ta@@ u@@ .    
 In shor@@ t, intellig@@ ence doesn't like to get tra@@ p@@ pe@@ d.    
 In@@ tellig@@ ence tri@@ es to maxim@@ ize future freedom of ac@@ tion and keep op@@ tions op@@ en.    
 And so, given this one equ@@ ation, it's natural to as@@ k, so what can you do with this?    
 How pre@@ dic@@ tive is it?    
 Do@@ es it pre@@ di@@ ct human@@ -@@ level intellig@@ enc@@ e?    
 Do@@ es it pre@@ di@@ ct arti@@ fic@@ ial intellig@@ enc@@ e?    
 So I'm going to show you now a video that will@@ , I think, de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate some of the amazing appli@@ cations of just this single equ@@ ation.    
  N@@ ar@@ r@@ ator@@ : R@@ ec@@ ent research in c@@ os@@ mo@@ logy has sugg@@ es@@ ted that uni@@ vers@@ es that produce more di@@ sor@@ d@@ er, or "@@ ent@@ ro@@ p@@ y@@ ," over their life@@ times should t@@ end to have more favor@@ able condi@@ tions for the exist@@ ence of intellig@@ ent be@@ ings such as our@@ selves.    
 But what if that t@@ ent@@ ative c@@ os@@ mo@@ logical connec@@ tion between ent@@ ro@@ p@@ y and intellig@@ ence h@@ in@@ ts at a deep@@ er relationshi@@ p@@ ?    
 What if intellig@@ ent behavi@@ or doesn't just cor@@ rel@@ ate with the produc@@ tion of long@@ -@@ term ent@@ ro@@ p@@ y, but actually emerg@@ es direc@@ tly from it?    
 To find out, we develop@@ ed a so@@ f@@ tw@@ are eng@@ ine called En@@ tro@@ pi@@ ca, desig@@ ned to maxim@@ ize the produc@@ tion of long@@ -@@ term ent@@ ro@@ p@@ y of any system that it fin@@ ds itself in.    
 A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly, En@@ tro@@ pic@@ a was able to pas@@ s multi@@ ple ani@@ mal intellig@@ ence tes@@ ts, play human gam@@ es, and even ear@@ n money tra@@ ding st@@ oc@@ ks, all without being in@@ struc@@ ted to do so@@ .    
 Here are some exam@@ ples of En@@ tro@@ pic@@ a in ac@@ tion.    
 Just like a human standing up@@ right without f@@ all@@ ing over@@ , here we see En@@ tro@@ pic@@ a au@@ tom@@ a@@ tically bal@@ anc@@ ing a po@@ le using a car@@ t.    
 This behavi@@ or is re@@ mar@@ k@@ able in part because we never gave En@@ tro@@ pic@@ a a go@@ al.    
 It simply decided on its own to bal@@ ance the po@@ le.    
 This bal@@ anc@@ ing ability will have appli@@ ac@@ tions for human@@ o@@ id robo@@ tics and human as@@ si@@ s@@ tive technologi@@ es.    
 Just as some anim@@ als can use objec@@ ts in their environ@@ ments as tools to re@@ ach into nar@@ row spac@@ es, here we see that En@@ tro@@ pi@@ ca, again on its own initi@@ a@@ tive, was able to move a large dis@@ k represent@@ ing an ani@@ mal around so as to cause a small dis@@ k, represent@@ ing a tool@@ , to re@@ ach into a con@@ fin@@ ed space hol@@ ding a third dis@@ k and rele@@ ase the third dis@@ k from its initi@@ ally fi@@ x@@ ed posi@@ tion.    
 This tool use ability will have appli@@ cations for smar@@ t man@@ u@@ f@@ actu@@ r@@ ing and ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture.    
 In ad@@ di@@ tion, just as some other anim@@ als are able to co@@ oper@@ ate by pul@@ ling op@@ pos@@ ite ends of a ro@@ pe at the same time to rele@@ ase food, here we see that En@@ tro@@ pic@@ a is able to ac@@ comp@@ lish a model ver@@ sion of that t@@ as@@ k.    
 This co@@ oper@@ ative ability has interesting imp@@ li@@ cations for econom@@ ic plan@@ ning and a vari@@ e@@ ty of other fiel@@ ds.    
 En@@ tro@@ pic@@ a is bro@@ ad@@ ly appli@@ ca@@ ble to a vari@@ e@@ ty of dom@@ ain@@ s.    
 For example, here we see it success@@ fully playing a game of p@@ ong against it@@ self, ill@@ u@@ str@@ ating its potential for gam@@ ing.

 A@@ le@@ x W@@ is@@ s@@ ner@@ -@@ G@@ ro@@ s@@ s: So what you've just seen is that a vari@@ e@@ ty of sig@@ nature human intellig@@ ent cog@@ ni@@ tive behavi@@ ors such as tool use and walking up@@ right and social co@@ oper@@ ation all follow from a single equ@@ ation, which dri@@ ves a system to maxim@@ ize its future freedom of ac@@ tion.    
 Now, there's a pro@@ found ir@@ on@@ y here.    
 Go@@ ing back to the beginning of the us@@ age of the term robo@@ t, the play "@@ R@@ U@@ R@@ ," there was always a concept that if we develop@@ ed machine intellig@@ ence, there would be a cy@@ ber@@ ne@@ tic re@@ vol@@ t.    
 The mach@@ ines would ri@@ se up against us.    
 One maj@@ or consequ@@ ence of this work is that maybe all of these deca@@ d@@ es, we've had the whole concept of cy@@ ber@@ ne@@ tic re@@ vol@@ t in re@@ ver@@ se.    
 It's not that mach@@ ines first become intellig@@ ent and then me@@ g@@ al@@ om@@ ani@@ a@@ cal and try to take over the world.    
 It's quite the op@@ pos@@ it@@ e, that the ur@@ ge to take control of all possible fu@@ tures is a more fundamental prin@@ ci@@ ple than that of intellig@@ ence, that gener@@ al intellig@@ ence may in fact em@@ er@@ ge direc@@ tly from this sort of contro@@ l@@ -@@ gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing, rather than vice ver@@ sa@@ .    
 A@@ no@@ ther important consequ@@ ence is goal see@@ king.    
 I'm often as@@ ke@@ d, how does the ability to see@@ k go@@ als follow from this sort of f@@ r@@ am@@ e@@ work@@ ?    
 And the answer is, the ability to see@@ k go@@ als will follow direc@@ tly from this in the follow@@ ing sen@@ se@@ : just like you would tra@@ vel through a tun@@ n@@ el, a bo@@ tt@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k in your future pat@@ h space, in order to achi@@ eve many other di@@ ver@@ se objec@@ tiv@@ es later on, or just like you would inv@@ est in a fin@@ anci@@ al se@@ cur@@ ity, re@@ duc@@ ing your sh@@ ort@@ -@@ term li@@ qu@@ id@@ ity in order to increase your we@@ al@@ th over the long ter@@ m, goal see@@ king emerg@@ es direc@@ tly from a long@@ -@@ term dri@@ ve    
 to increase future freedom of ac@@ tion.    
 F@@ in@@ ally, Ri@@ ch@@ ard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man, fam@@ ous physic@@ ist@@ , once wrote that if human ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation were des@@ tro@@ yed and you could pas@@ s only a single concept on to our des@@ c@@ end@@ an@@ ts to help them re@@ build ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation, that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny el@@ em@@ ents that at@@ tr@@ act each other when they're far a@@ part but re@@ pe@@ l each other when they're close together.    
 My e@@ qui@@ val@@ ent of that st@@ at@@ ement to pas@@ s on to des@@ c@@ end@@ an@@ ts to help them build arti@@ fic@@ ial intellig@@ ences or to help them understand human intellig@@ ence, is the follow@@ ing@@ : In@@ tellig@@ ence should be view@@ ed as a physical process that tri@@ es to maxim@@ ize future freedom of ac@@ tion and a@@ vo@@ id con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts in its own fu@@ ture.    
 Thank you very much.
